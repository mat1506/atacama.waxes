  abstract = {Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).},

  abstract = {Hyperarid climates in western South America from 15{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S to 29{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, extending up to 3,000 m in the northern Chilean Andes, result primarily from the Andes intercepting precipitation from the Intertropical Convergence and the drying effect of the equatorward-running Humboldt Current bathing much of the Pacific coast of South America. Paleobotanical, paleontological, and geological evidence suggests that such harsh climatic conditions developed very recently in Holocene times, following a turbulent Pleistocene history of alternating wet/cold and warm/dry periods. Seasonal climates probably first emerged in the Pliocene after a long, warm/wet Miocene during which precipitation is thought to have increased from east to west, as opposed to west to east, as occurs north of 25{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S today. For the three remaining intact vegetation belts (desert scrub, Andean, and high Andean) in the northern Chilean Andes above the Atacama Desert, surveys on six transects, each approximately one-fourth of a degree latitude wide, located at 18{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 19{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 21{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 24{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 26{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 28{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, revealed only 769 species of vascular plants in 290 genera. Altitudinally, species richness decreases with elevation in the winter rainfall zone, where precipitation is received from the southwest ("invierno chileno"; transects 26{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 28{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S), to peak at mid elevations in the summer rainfall zone where precipitation is received from the east ("invierno boliviano"; transects 18{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 19{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 21{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S, 24{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S). Species richness decreases by 80\% and cover by 50\% over the very severe rainfall gradient from 18-24{$\mdsmwhtcircle$}S. In spite of its greater reliance on water, the azonal bog flora has been less affected than the zonal flora by aridity, probably because of greater chances of reintroduction of species following their loss through long-distance dispersal. Species richness, when considered on a broad biogeographical scale, was significantly positively correlated with mean annual rainfall, as it was for most 500-m elevational levels when considered separately. The effect of cold temperatures at the higher elevations was completely obliterated by aridity on a biogeographical scale. Although diversity (measured as a synthetic characteristic combining richness and abundance) and species richness showed similar trends as aridity increases, loss of diversity tended to be more gradual in comparison with reductions in species richness. Aridity leads to community features analogous to those seen in the early stages of primary succession, maintained on a permanent basis. Losses in species richness with aridity along the western side of the Andes and from east to west across the Andes were overlain by highly characteristic life form tendencies. Perennial herbs are proportionately most abundant in areas of highest rainfall, annual herbs gain greatest prominence in areas of intermediate aridity, while woody species were proportionately most strongly represented under extreme dry/warm and extreme dry/cold conditions. The woody habit is generally more common in the northern Andes than in some similar North American plant communities. The maintenance of considerable diversity (in spite of severe loss in species richness) coupled with emphasis on long-lived woody species in the harshest environments in the northern Chilean Andes are tendencies also seen in many species-rich, climatically benign tropical plant communities. The hypothesis is developed that convergence in these features results from the similar selective effects of certain abiotic and biotic factors in the harsh arid environments of the northern Chilean Andes and in species-rich tropical communities, respectively. We predict that additional life-history trait similarities (e.g., in breeding systems) will emerge for the plant species of abiotically and biotically "harsh" environments, respectively.}

Comparisons of phenological behaviour and overall phenological patterns were made at six altitudes between 2320 and 3550 m, including both north- and south-facing slopes. (2) Nine categories of phenological behaviour and their altitudinal distribution are described. The percentage of summer-dormant species (dying back before the onset of winter) reaches a maximum at 2320 m ({$>$}75\% of all species), and generally decreases with altitude. More summer-dormant species are present on north-facing (equatorial) slopes than on south-facing slopes. (3) The maximum growing season within the andean zone was 8 months at 2320 m altitude; the minimum growing season was 5 months on south-facing slopes at 3410 m. Shrubs and cushion plants had the longest period of vegetative activity, followed by perennial herbs and sub-shrubs, and then by geophytes and annuals. (4) Flowering in some species began before snowmelt, and continued until autumn, reaching a maximum in the austral summer between late December and late February at the altitudinal extremes. Peak flowering corresponded with the period of maximum temperature at lower altitudes, but was displaced after this period at higher altitudes and on south-facing slopes. (5) The average length of the flowering period for each species increased with altitude, approximately doubling over 1200 m altitude. Fruits of some species failed to mature both on some of the north-facing slopes and on most south-facing slopes in 1979. (6) Slower floral development at higher altitudes accounted for about two-thirds of the difference in the lengths of the flowering periods at the altitudinal extremes. (7) Checks in 1979-80 indicated that the phenological patterns detected in 1978-79 remained constant from one year to another. (8) The phenological behaviour of annuals, geophytes and some perennial herbs suggests that they may have been derived from the lower mediterranean matorral flora.},

Although this area plays a key role in global climate cycles, little is known about South American climate history. Here we describe sediment cores and down-hole logging results of deep drilling in the Salar de Uyuni, on the Bolivian Altiplano, located in the tropical Andes. We demonstrate that during the past 50,000 years the Altiplano underwent important changes in effective moisture at both orbital (20,000-year) and millennial timescales. Long-duration wet periods, such as the Last Glacial Maximum\textemdash marked in the drill core by continuous deposition of lacustrine sediments\textemdash appear to have occurred in phase with summer insolation maxima produced by the Earth's precessional cycle. Short-duration, millennial events correlate well with North Atlantic cold events, including Heinrich events 1 and 2, as well as the Younger Dryas episode. At both millennial and orbital timescales, cold sea surface temperatures in the high-latitude North Atlantic were coeval with wet conditions in tropical South America, suggesting a common forcing.},

  abstract = {With ongoing climate change, the probability of crossing environmental thresholds promoting abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning is higher than ever. In drylands (areas where it rains {$<$}65\% of what could be potentially evaporated), recent research has shown how the crossing of three aridity thresholds [at aridity (1-Aridity Index) values of 0.54, 0.70 and 0.80] leads to abrupt changes on ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Despite the importance of these findings and their implications to develop effective monitoring and adaptation actions to combat climate change and desertification, we lack a proper understanding of the mechanisms unleashing these abrupt shifts. Here we review multiple mechanisms that may explain the existence of aridity thresholds observed across global drylands, and discuss the potential amplification mechanisms that may underpin hypothetical abrupt temporal shifts with climate change. We propose that each aridity threshold is caused by different and specific mechanisms. The first threshold is mainly caused by physiological mechanisms of plant adaptation to water shortages. The second threshold is unleashed by different mechanisms involving soil processes and plant\textendash soil interactions such as soil erosion, plant community shifts and nutrient cycling and circulation. The collapse of vegetation observed once the third aridity threshold (0.8) is crossed is caused by the mechanisms related to the survival limits of plants that may cause sudden cover and diversity losses and plant\textendash atmospheric feedbacks that link vegetation collapse with further climate aridification. By identifying, revising and linking relevant mechanisms to each aridity threshold observed, we provide a set of specific hypotheses and identify knowledge gaps concerning the study of threshold emergence in drylands. We were also able to establish plausible factors that are context dependent and may influence the occurrence of abrupt ecosystem changes in time. Our review may help to focus future research efforts on aridity thresholds and to develop strategies to monitor, adapt to or even revert abrupt ecosystem changes across global drylands.

Higher elevation shrubs and summer-flowering grasses expanded downslope across what is now the edge of Absolute Desert, a broad expanse now largely devoid of rainfall and vegetation. Paradoxically, this pluvial period coincided with the summer insolation minimum and reduced adiabatic heating over the central Andes. Summer precipitation over the central Andes and central Atacama may depend on remote teleconnections between seasonal insolation forcing in both hemispheres, the Asian monsoon, and Pacific sea surface temperature gradients. A less pronounced episode of higher groundwater levels in the central Atacama from 8 to 3 ky B.P. conflicts with an extreme lowstand of Lake Titicaca, indicating either different climatic forcing or different response times and sensitivities to climatic change.},

  abstract = {Abstract In many hyperarid ecosystems, such as the Atacama Desert, fog is the most important freshwater source. To study biological and geological processes in such water-limited regions, knowledge about the spatiotemporal distribution and variability of fog presence is necessary. In this study, in situ measurements provided by a network of climate stations equipped, inter alia, with leaf wetness sensors are utilized to create a reference fog dataset that enables the validation of satellite-based fog retrieval methods. Further, a new satellite-based fog-detection approach is introduced that uses brightness temperatures measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for a neural network. Such a machine learning technique can exploit all spectral information of the satellite data and represent potential nonlinear relationships. Relative to a second fog-detection approach based on MODIS cloud-top height retrievals, the neural network reaches a higher detection skill (Heidke skill score of 0.56 as compared with 0.49). A suitable representation of temporal variability on subseasonal time scales is provided with correlations mostly greater than 0.7 between fog occurrence time series derived from the neural network and the reference data for individual climate stations, respectively. Furthermore, a suitable spatial representativity of the neural-network approach to expand the application to the whole region is indicated. Three-year averages of fog frequencies reveal similar spatial patterns for the austral winter season for both approaches. However, differences are found for the summer and potential reasons are discussed.},

Cylindoputia/Opuntia cuticles were abundant throughout both the Pleistocene and Holocene. Together, these species comprised the bulk of the woodrats' diet during the last ice age. The glacial-interglacial transition showed the replacement of extralocals in the diet by more xeric desert scrub species, especially Acacia greggii, Larrea tridentata, Olneya tesota, and Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana. The main dietary species were all also highly abundant as macrofossils, suggesting preferential collection of favored foods. Interestingly, J.~californica and Nolina cuticles persisted {$>$}1500 years after disappearing from macrofossils, while O.~tesota cuticles appeared 4160 years earlier. It is possible that consumption of particularly prized foods at times they were less abundant left little material for incorporation into middens. Analyzing cuticles along with macrofossils from middens provides complimentary information about woodrat dietary preferences, helps refine the timing of species arrivals/disappearances, and shows how diets shifted with changing climatic conditions.},

The latest mid-Holocene simulations are a palaeoclimate entry card for the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP4) component of the current phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) \textendash{} hereafter referred to as PMIP4-CMIP6. Here we provide an initial analysis and evaluation of the results of the experiment for the mid-Holocene. We show that state-of-the-art models produce climate changes that are broadly consistent with theory and observations, including increased summer warming of the Northern Hemisphere and associated shifts in tropical rainfall. Many features of the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations were present in the previous generation (PMIP3-CMIP5) of simulations. The PMIP4-CMIP6 ensemble for the mid-Holocene has a global mean temperature change of -0.3\&thinsp;K, which is -0.2\&thinsp;K cooler than the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations predominantly as a result of the prescription of realistic greenhouse gas concentrations in PMIP4-CMIP6. Biases in the magnitude and the sign of regional responses identified in PMIP3-CMIP5, such as the amplification of the northern African monsoon, precipitation changes over Europe, and simulated aridity in mid-Eurasia, are still present in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations. Despite these issues, PMIP4-CMIP6 and the mid-Holocene provide an opportunity both for quantitative evaluation and derivation of emergent constraints on the hydrological cycle, feedback strength, and potentially climate sensitivity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The distributions of long chain n-alkanes are often utilized as plant-derived paleoenvironmental proxies. However, there is debate regarding the degree to which photosynthetic pathway, temperature and/or hydrology drive the variation in chain length distribution observed among different environments. In order to assess the influence of temperature and photosynthetic pathway on plant n-alkanes, this study examined n-alkane chain length distributions in plants and soils along a transect across mid-continental USA spanning {$>$}20\textdegree C mean annual temperature with a limited range of mean annual precipitation. We found that (i) longer chain length in plants and soils correlated with higher growing season temperature, with relative humidity also a possible driver, (ii) soils exhibited a stronger correlation with temperature than did individual plants, which may reflect the averaging of plant input to soils and (iii) average chain length values in soils did not correlate with the predominance of C4 plants. The data suggest that the spatial and temporal variation in chain length distributions observed in studies of sediment archives may be driven in large part by growing season temperature and/or aridity rather than photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4). The findings call for further research into the mechanisms and effects of leaf wax composition on water permeability under different environmental conditions, the relationship between leaf wax n-alkanes and relative humidity, and the incorporation of n-alkanes into soils and sediments.},

Dozens of studies have examined the range and variation of n-alkane chain-length abundances in modern plants from around the world, and n-alkane distributions have been used for a variety of purposes in paleoclimatology and paleoecology as well as chemotaxonomy. However, most of the paleoecological applications of n-alkane distributions have been based on a narrow set of modern data that cannot address intra- and inter-plant variability. Here, we present the results of a study using trees from near Chicago, IL, USA, as well as a meta-analysis of published data on modern plant n-alkane distributions. First, we test the conformity of n-alkane distributions in mature leaves across the canopy of 38 individual plants from 24 species as well as across a single growing season and find no significant differences for either canopy position or time of leaf collection. Second, we compile 2093 observations from 86 sources, including the new data here, to examine the generalities of n-alkane parameters such as carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), and chain-length ratios for different plant groups. We show that angiosperms generally produce more n-alkanes than do gymnosperms, supporting previous observations, and furthermore that CPI values show such variation in modern plants that it is prudent to discard the use of CPI as a quantitative indicator of n-alkane degradation in sediments. We also test the hypotheses that certain n-alkane chain lengths predominate in and therefore can be representative of particular plant groups, namely, C23 and C25 in Sphagnum mosses, C27 and C29 in woody plants, and C31 in graminoids (grasses). We find that chain-length distributions are highly variable within plant groups, such that chemotaxonomic distinctions between grasses and woody plants are difficult to make based on n-alkane abundances. In contrast, Sphagnum mosses are marked by their predominance of C23 and C25, chain lengths which are largely absent in terrestrial vascular plants. The results here support the use of C23 as a robust proxy for Sphagnum mosses in paleoecological studies, but not the use of C27, C29, and C31 to separate graminoids and woody plants from one another, as both groups produce highly variable but significant amounts of all three chain lengths. In Africa, C33 and C35 chain lengths appear to distinguish graminoids from some woody plants, but this may be a reflection of the differences in rainforest and savanna environments. Indeed, variation in the abundances of long n-alkane chain lengths may be responding in part to local environmental conditions, and this calls for a more directed examination of the effects of temperature and aridity on plant n-alkane distributions in natural environments.},

  abstract = {The environmental controls on leaf wax n-alkane distributions and associated interpretation of such distributions in geological archives have long remained rather enigmatic. Studies of contemporary vegetation often conflate changing environmental conditions and species differences between biomes, making it difficult to assess the extent to which variation is driven by plant adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions and/or more fixed chemotaxonomic patterns. We present a case study of arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa that considers these issues. We anticipate that such conditions may impart strong controls upon leaf wax synthesis. Leaf wax n-alkane data from 215 plants and 93 soils from the Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes of South Africa revealed yield and distributions to be highly variable. While many plants exhibited concentrations comparable with previous reports, several succulent plants produced n-alkane yield up to 100\texttimes{} the modal n-alkane concentration for their biome. The data demonstrate that, on average, leaf wax n-alkane distributions in the Succulent Karoo are different from those of the Fynbos biome, with the former associated with longer maximum chain length, less dispersed distributions and stronger odd numbered chain length preference. The patterns were closely mirrored in the soils. Average chain length was weakly correlated with climate and this is interpreted to be a function of multiple factors. We hypothesise that a key control is the shifting proportion of plant functional type between biomes, with a greater abundance of succulent growth forms in the more arid Succulent Karoo (which tended to produce longer and less dispersed n-alkane chain length distributions), differentiating this biome from the Fynbos, in which woody shrubs are more dominant. Inter-biome variability was also apparent, with some same taxonomic or functional groups common to both biomes tending to produce longer chain length n-alkane distributions under more arid conditions. There was, however, considerable individual plant variability and we observed both insensitivity to environmental conditions (i.e. consistent n-alkane distributions) and marked variability in chain length distributions. A key finding is the high yield of n-alkanes from multiple succulent plants, many of which use the CAM photosynthetic pathway. Compound specific {$\delta$}13C/{$\delta$}D analyses (e.g. estimates of C3 and C4 biomass) for regions with potential succulent plant contributions should therefore be carried out cautiously.},

To date, organic geochemical proxies have been developed mainly for use in marine systems and are widely used in paleoceanography. In contrast, organic proxies have been less commonly used on lacustrine sedimentary records. One reason for this is that the wide range in the physical and chemical properties of lakes complicates application of some organic geochemical proxies in lacustrine settings. Furthermore, in comparison to marine studies, presently only a small number of studies have conducted or are currently conducting fundamental research aimed at developing organic geochemical proxies for use in lacustrine settings. Despite this, an increasing number of (paleo)limnological studies are currently applying organic geochemical techniques to examine present and past environmental conditions. In this manuscript we review the use of a number of commonly utilized organic geochemical and isotopic proxies and discuss their potential for environmental reconstruction in Quaternary lacustrine deposits.},

  abstract = {Plant leaf waxes are used as vegetation biomarkers in several archives (i.e. soils, lake and marine sediments), study of these compounds in modern plants is needed to makes their application and interpretation more robust. However, in the South American Temperate Forest (STF), few species have been studied. The main goal of this research was to characterize twelve dominant modern species of the STF using three classes of leaf wax compounds, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes and n-alkanols. In addition, we evaluate the potential of leaf waxes as a vegetation and chemotaxonomic biomarker in the region, considering species that were found in different sampling sites and therefore environmental conditions. Clear differences among leaf wax abundance ({$\mu$}g/g) and ACL (average chain length) within and among the twelve species were found. Only the ACL of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols allows differentiation between leaf habit species (i.e. evergreen vs. deciduous), with high values associated with evergreen and low values with deciduous plants. This study differentiates the five species found in more than one site (i.e. different environmental condition) using different combinations of leaf waxes and in addition using only n-alkanes. It was not possible to differentiate among all sites with any combination of leaf waxes. The differences in the distribution of leaf waxes among species is an expected pattern in the study area, and it seems reliable to use the ACL as a vegetation biomarker differentiating between evergreen and deciduous species. The clear chemotaxonomic differences among the five species exposed to different and natural environmental conditions and the high preservation potential of the study area allow us to suggest that leaf waxes are likely a reliable tool to be incorporated in quantitative models to track vegetation and may be useful as a chemotaxonomic biomarker at the species level.},

  abstract = {The n-alkyl leaf waxes of the temperate forest of South America are poorly studied, despite being a biogeographically isolated forest spanning wide environmental conditions. To evaluate whether local species adaptation and environmental changes influence the n-alkyl leaf wax composition, we measured the molecular abundance and distribution of n-alkyl leaf waxes (n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes and n-alkanols) of three dominant native species from southern temperate forest in South America. We surveyed Araucaria araucana (n\,=\,9), Nothofagus dombeyi (n\,=\,17) and Chusquea sp. (n\,=\,21) at different elevations. The relationship of n-alkyl leaf wax abundance and distribution with elevation is not significant in any species, except for n-alkane ACL (average chain length) in Chusquea sp. Significant correlations are found for n-alkanoic acid abundance with precipitation and aridity in Chusquea sp. and n-alkane abundance and ACL with temperature in A. araucana. These data suggest a species-specific response to environmental variables. The main similarity in the three species is a higher abundance of n-alkanoic acids ({$>$}60\%) relative to other n-alkyl leaf waxes. Only n-alkanols are not correlated to any environmental variable, and neither ACL nor Cmax overlap among species. These results suggest n-alkanols as a potential chemotaxonomic indicator at a lower taxonomic level in the region.},

  abstract = {The El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary driver of interannual climate variability in the tropics and subtropics. Despite substantial progress in understanding ocean\textendash atmosphere feedbacks that drive ENSO today, relatively little is known about its behavior on centennial and longer timescales. Paleoclimate records from lakes, corals, molluscs and deep-sea sediments generally suggest that ENSO variability was weaker during the mid-Holocene (4\textendash 6 kyr\,BP) than the late Holocene (0\textendash 4 kyr\,BP). However, discrepancies amongst the records preclude a clear timeline of Holocene ENSO evolution and therefore the attribution of ENSO variability to specific climate forcing mechanisms. Here we present {$\delta$}18O results from a U\textendash Th dated speleothem in Malaysian Borneo sampled at sub-annual resolution. The {$\delta$}18O of Borneo rainfall is a robust proxy of regional convective intensity and precipitation amount, both of which are directly influenced by ENSO activity. Our estimates of stalagmite {$\delta$}18O variance at ENSO periods (2\textendash 7 yr) show a significant reduction in interannual variability during the mid-Holocene (3240\textendash 3380 and 5160\textendash 5230 yr\,BP) relative to both the late Holocene (2390\textendash 2590 yr\,BP) and early Holocene (6590\textendash 6730 yr\,BP). The Borneo results are therefore inconsistent with lacustrine records of ENSO from the eastern equatorial Pacific that show little or no ENSO variance during the early Holocene. Instead, our results support coral, mollusc and foraminiferal records from the central and eastern equatorial Pacific that show a mid-Holocene minimum in ENSO variance. Reduced mid-Holocene interannual {$\delta$}18O variability in Borneo coincides with an overall minimum in mean {$\delta$}18O from 3.5 to 5.5 kyr\,BP. Persistent warm pool convection would tend to enhance the Walker circulation during the mid-Holocene, which likely contributed to reduced ENSO variance during this period. This finding implies that both convective intensity and interannual variability in Borneo are driven by coupled air-sea dynamics that are sensitive to precessional insolation forcing. Isolating the exact mechanisms that drive long-term ENSO evolution will require additional high-resolution paleoclimatic reconstructions and further investigation of Holocene tropical climate evolution using coupled climate models.},

Individuals of this species have begun to show foliar damage (i.e., discoloration) in branches and upper parts. The discoloration begins from the base to the top and from the trunk to the branches with necrotic rings appearing; in some cases causing death; and is currently attributed to an as yet unknown disease. This study focuses on the first protective layer of plants against environmental stress and pathogens; known as leaf waxes. The abundance and distribution of three classes of leaf waxes (long chain fatty acids; alkanes and alcohols) were measured in healthy individuals of A. araucana from different sites and individuals that present foliar damage (sick individuals). In the case of sick individuals; their leaf waxes were measured considering the level of leaf damage; that is; leaves without; medium and full foliar damage. The most abundant class of leaf wax in both sick and healthy individuals was fatty acids; followed by alkanes and then alcohols; with common dominant chains; C28 fatty acid; C29 alkane and C24 alcohol. Sick individuals have higher abundances of alkanes and alcohols than healthy individuals. The leaves of sick individuals have lower values of distribution indices (the carbon preference index of fatty acids and average chain length of alkanes) as foliar damage increases that are interpreted as a reduction of in vivo biosynthesis of waxes. This is the first evidence of A. araucana response to a still unknown disease that is killing individuals of this endemic species.},

Although most studies have focused on the hyper-aridity prevalent since the Miocene, all terrestrial sediments in the region from the late Triassic onwards also record evaporitic and thus arid climates. Supergene mineralization in the region did not develop under a more humid climate conducive to deep weathering, but under arid conditions. These processes may have been facilitated by hydrological changes during Miocene uplift and drainage incision, but were operational prior to the uplift. Similarly, global cooling and changes to oceanic circulation in the post Miocene period only accentuated existing conditions. A whole regolith perspective is vital to understanding the history of aridity in the Atacama Desert and its relevance to arid zone morphogenesis, regolith formation, and supergene mineralization. In particular, the long history of aridity raises the possibility that supergene mineralisation, under the appropriate conditions, form in arid environments, instead of requiring humid conditions.},

To a degree, all climate proxies are affected by age uncertainties, which are seldom quantified. This article proposes a probabilistic age model for proxies based on layer-counted chronologies, and explores its use for annually banded coral archives. The model considers both missing and doubly counted growth increments (represented as independent processes), accommodates various assumptions about error rates, and allows one to quantify the impact of chronological uncertainties on different diagnostics of variability. In the case of a single coral record, we find that time uncertainties primarily affect high-frequency signals but also significantly bias the estimate of decadal signals. We further explore tuning to an independent, tree-ring-based chronology as a way to identify an optimal age model. A synthetic pseudocoral network is used as testing ground to quantify uncertainties in the estimation of spatiotemporal patterns of variability. Even for small error rates, the amplitude of multidecadal variability is systematically overestimated at the expense of interannual variability (El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, in this case), artificially flattening its spectrum at periods longer than 10 years. An optimization approach to correct chronological errors in coherent multivariate records is presented and validated in idealized cases, though it is found difficult to apply in practice due to the large number of solutions. We close with a discussion of possible extensions of this model and connections to existing strategies for modeling age uncertainties.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In the hyperarid Atacama Desert, water availability plays a crucial role in allowing plant survival. Along with scant rainfall, marine advective fog frequently occurs along the coastal escarpment fueling isolated mono-specific patches of Tillandsia vegetation. In this study, we investigate the lipid biomarker composition of the bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii (CAM plant) to assess structural adaptations at the molecular level as a response to extremely arid conditions. We analyzed long-chain n-alkanes and fatty acids in living specimens (n\,=\,59) collected from the main Tillandsia dune ecosystems across a 350~km coastal transect. We found that the leaf wax composition was dominated by n-alkanes with concentrations (total average 160.8\,{$\pm$}\,91.4~\textmu g/g) up to three times higher than fatty acids (66.7\,{$\pm$}\,40.7~\textmu g/g), likely as an adaptation to the hyperarid environment. Significant differences were found in leaf wax distribution (Average Chain Length [ACL] and Carbon Preference Index [CPI]) in the northern zone relative to the central and southern zones. We found strong negative correlations between fatty acid CPI and n-alkane ACL with precipitation and surface evaporation pointing at fine-scale adaptations to low moisture availability along the coastal transect. Moreover, our data indicate that the predominance of n-alkanes is reflecting the function of the wax in preventing water loss from the leaves. The hyperarid conditions and good preservation potential of both n-alkanes and fatty acids make them ideal tracers to study late Holocene climate change in the Atacama Desert.},

  abstract = {The hyperarid Atacama Desert coast receives scarce moisture inputs mainly from the Pacific Ocean in the form of marine advective fog. The collected moisture supports highly specialized ecosystems, where the bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii is the dominant species. The fog and low clouds (FLCs) on which these ecosystems depend are affected in their interannual variability and spatial distribution by global phenomena, such as ENSO. Yet, there is a lack of understanding of how ENSO influences recent FLCs spatial changes and their interconnections and how these variations can affect existing Tillandsia stands. In this study, we analyze FLCs occurrence, its trends and the influence of ENSO on the interannual variations of FLCs presence by processing GOES satellite images (1995\textendash 2017). Our results show that ENSO exerts a significant influence over FLCs interannual variability in the Atacama at\,\textasciitilde\,20\textdegree S. Linear regression analyses reveal a relation between ENSO3.4 anomalies and FLCs with opposite seasonal effects depending on the ENSO phase. During summer (winter), the ENSO warm phase is associated with an increase (decrease) of the FLCs occurrence, whereas the opposite occurs during ENSO cool phases. In addition, the ONI Index explains up to\,\textasciitilde\,50 and\,\textasciitilde\,60\% variance of the interannual FLCs presence in the T. landbeckii site during summer and winter, respectively. Finally, weak negative (positive) trends of FLCs presence are observed above (below) 1000~m a.~s.~l. These results have direct implications for understanding the present and past distribution of Tillandsia ecosystems under the extreme conditions characterizing our study area.},

Some such records suggest that the last deglaciation was punctuated by a dramatic period of sea-level rise, of about 20\,metres, in less than 500\,years. Controversy about the amplitude and timing of this meltwater pulse (MWP-1A) has, however, led to uncertainty about the source of the melt water and its temporal and causal relationships with the abrupt climate changes of the deglaciation. Here we show that MWP-1A started no earlier than 14,650 years ago and ended before 14,310 years ago, making it coeval with the B\o lling warming. Our results, based on corals drilled offshore from Tahiti during Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Expedition 310, reveal that the increase in sea level at Tahiti was between 12 and 22 metres, with a most probable value between 14 and 18 metres, establishing a significant meltwater contribution from the Southern Hemisphere. This implies that the rate of eustatic sea-level rise exceeded 40 millimetres per year during MWP-1A.},

Ancient DNA (aDNA) metabarcoding allows biodiversity responses to major climatic change to be explored at different spatial and temporal scales. We extracted aDNA preserved in fossil rodent middens to reconstruct late Quaternary vegetation dynamics in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. By comparing our paleo-informed millennial record with contemporary observations of interannual variations in diversity, we show local plant communities behave differentially at different timescales. In the interannual (years to decades) time frame, only annual herbaceous expand and contract their distributional ranges (emerging from persistent seed banks) in response to precipitation, whereas perennials distribution appears to be extraordinarily resilient. In contrast, at longer timescales (thousands of years) many perennial species were displaced up to 1,000 m downslope during pluvial events. Given ongoing and future natural and anthropogenically induced climate change, our results not only provide baselines for vegetation in the Atacama Desert, but also help to inform how these and other high mountain plant communities may respond to fluctuations of climate in the future.},

Location Sites are located along the lower and upper fringes of absolute desert (1100\textendash 2800 m a.s.l.), between the western slope of the Andes and the Coastal Ranges of northern Chile (24\textendash 26\textdegree{} S). Methods We collected and individually radiocarbon dated 21 rodent middens. Plant macrofossils (fruits, seeds, flowers and leaves) were identified and pollen content analysed. Midden assemblages afford brief snapshots of local plant communities that existed within the rodents' limited foraging range during the several years to decades that it took the midden to accumulate. These assemblages were then compared with modern floras to determine the presence of extralocal species and species provenance. Results Five middens span the last glacial period (34\textendash 21 ka) and three middens are from the last glacial\textendash interglacial transition (19\textendash 11 ka). The remaining 13 middens span the last 7000 years. Coastal hyperarid sites exhibit low taxonomic richness in middens at 19.3, 1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.5 ka and a modern sample. Middens are also dominated by the same plants that occur today. In contrast, middens dated to 28.1, 21.3, 17.3, 3.7 and 0.5 ka contain more species, including Andean extralocals. Precordillera middens (c. 2700 m) show a prominent increase in plant macrofossil richness, along with the appearance of Andean extralocals and sedges at 34.5 and 18.9 ka. Six younger middens dated to 6.1\textendash 0.1 ka are similar to the modern local vegetation. Main conclusions Increased species richness and Andean extralocal plants occurred along the current lower fringes of absolute desert during the last glacial\textendash interglacial transition and late Holocene. The absence of soil carbonates indicates the persistence of absolute desert throughout the Quaternary. Colonization by Andean plants could have been accomplished through long-distance seed dispersal either by animals or floods that originated in the Andes. We postulate that dispersal would have been most frequent during regional pluvial events and associated increases in groundwater levels, forming local wetlands in the absolute desert, and generating large floods capable of crossing the Central Depression.},

Over the past decade, considerable efforts have been made to constrain the factors that influence plant biomarkers and their carbon isotope composition to improve their utility for paleo applications. Global and regional replication of time intervals of great interest, such as during carbon cycle perturbations, has increased the need to compare among sites, but doing so has also complicated interpretation of carbon cycle perturbations due to the differences among records. This has led to questions regarding the fidelity of isotope records, the sensitivity of the isotope record to climate, and the best practices for reconciling records. But, at the same time, it has led to new exciting information on ecosystem responses to climate change. By removing competing influences of climate, ecosystem and biology, modern biomarker and isotope calibrations provide a means of reconciling and improving paleorecords and placing quantitative constraints on their interpretation. Here, we review the factors that influence the concentration of plant biomarkers and their carbon isotope composition and provide best practices for reconciling biomarker carbon isotope records for interpreting climate, ecosystem, and carbon cycling in the geologic past.},

Qualitatively, the chromatograms were  similar for all individuals sampled from 29 natural populations in  Chile and Argentina, showing C33 and C35  alkanes to be dominant. Quantitatively, the chromatograms varied  significantly among populations. Multivariate  analyses showed that arid zone populations from mediterranean Chile and   the Patagonian steppe were different  from one another and were distinct from mesic populations close to the   Valdivian rainforest vegetation zone.  Mediterranean Chilean populations were characterized by higher  concentrations of the longer carbon-chain  alkanes, but retained equal amounts of shorter-chain homologues as  the mesic populations. A greater variation in  chain lengths and higher concentrations of longer carbon chains in  the mediterranean populations is consistent  with a model for the adaptation to reduced cuticular permeability.  Partial Mantel matrix tests revealed significant  climatic and inter-population distance effects with taxonomic  distances based on multivariate and univariate  hydrocarbon data. Annual rainfall was overall the most significant  factor, particularly in regressions with the  shorter-chain hydrocarbons. Annual mean temperature was most  significant for the longer-chain hydrocarbons.  This suggests, on the one hand, ecogenic adaptation to both temperature   and precipitation of cuticular  hydrocarbon composition, and, on the other hand, a weaker, but important   effect of gene flow in determining  hydrocarbon composition in this species. The northernmost populations at   San Felipe and San Gabriel were the  most distinctive. This could result from the effects of random changes   in allele frequencies and/or to founder  effects in isolated and small populations. These populations show some   East-Andean affinities presumably due to historic migration patterns.},

Alkanes can also be used to estimate diet composition and the procedures required to do this are also described, including the special case where supplementary feed is treated as a component of the diet composition estimate. The long-chain alcohols (LCOHs) and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) of plant wax show particular promise for discriminating a greater number of species in the diet. The use of all these plant-wax markers in nutrition studies depends on having quantitative, repeatable and mutually compatible assay procedures for alkanes, LCOHs and VLCFAs; we present protocols for these assays in detail. Analysis of a single sample of feces or plant material for all these plant-wax markers can be completed within 2 days; however, it is possible to process up to 50 samples (analyzed in duplicate) per week.},

In this scenario, understanding wild plant adaptations in extreme ecosystems offers an opportunity to learn about new mechanisms for resilience. Previous studies have shown species specificity for metabolites involved in plant adaptation to harsh environments. Here, we combined multispecies ecological metabolomics and machine learning-based generalized linear model predictions to link the metabolome to the plant environment in a set of 24 species belonging to 14 families growing along an altitudinal gradient in the Atacama Desert. Thirty-nine common compounds predicted the plant environment with 79\% accuracy, thus establishing the plant metabolome as an excellent integrative predictor of environmental fluctuations. These metabolites were independent of the species and validated both statistically and biologically using an independent dataset from a different sampling year. Thereafter, using multiblock predictive regressions, metabolites were linked to climatic and edaphic stressors such as freezing temperature, water deficit and high solar irradiance. These findings indicate that plants from different evolutionary trajectories use a generic metabolic toolkit to face extreme environments. These core metabolites, also present in agronomic species, provide a unique metabolic goldmine for improving crop performances under abiotic pressure.},

Marine molecular records especially are proving to be of value but certain environmentally persistent compounds can also be measured in lake sediments, loess deposits and ice cores. The fundamentals of this approach are the molecular parameters, the compound abundances and carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic contents which can be derived by the analysis of sediment extracts. These afford proxy measures which can be interpreted in terms of the conditions which control climate and also reflect its operation. We discuss two types of proxy; those of terrigenous and those of aquatic origin, and exemplify their application in the study of marine sediments through the medium of ten case studies based in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific Oceans, and in Antarctica. The studies are mainly for periods in the present, the Holocene and particularly the last glacial/interglacial, but they also include one study from the Cretaceous. The terrigenous proxies, which are measures of continental vegetation, are based on higher plant leaf wax compounds, i.e. long-chain (circa C30) hydrocarbons, alcohols and acids. They register the relative contributions of C3 vs. C4 type plants to the vegetation in the source areas. The two marine proxies are measures of sea surface temperatures (SST). The longer established one, (U37K{${'}$}) is based on the relative abundances of C37 alkenones photosynthesized by unicellular algae, members of the Haptophyta. The newest proxy (TEX86) is based on C86 glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) synthesized in the water column by some of the archaeal microbiota, the Crenarchaeota.},

Yet, dozens of species grow there, including Atacama-endemic plants. Herein, we establish the Talabre\textendash Lej\'ia transect (TLT) in the Atacama as an unparalleled natural laboratory to study plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. We characterized climate, soil, plant, and soil\textendash microbe diversity at 22 sites (every 100 m of altitude) along the TLT over a 10-y period. We quantified drought, nutrient deficiencies, large diurnal temperature oscillations, and pH gradients that define three distinct vegetational belts along the altitudinal cline. We deep-sequenced transcriptomes of 32 dominant plant species spanning the major plant clades, and assessed soil microbes by metabarcoding sequencing. The top-expressed genes in the 32 Atacama species are enriched in stress responses, metabolism, and energy production. Moreover, their root-associated soils are enriched in growth-promoting bacteria, including nitrogen fixers. To identify genes associated with plant adaptation to harsh environments, we compared 32 Atacama species with the 32 closest sequenced species, comprising 70 taxa and 1,686,950 proteins. To perform phylogenomic reconstruction, we concatenated 15,972 ortholog groups into a supermatrix of 8,599,764 amino acids. Using two codon-based methods, we identified 265 candidate positively selected genes (PSGs) in the Atacama plants, 64\% of which are located in Pfam domains, supporting their functional relevance. For 59/184 PSGs with an Arabidopsis ortholog, we uncovered functional evidence linking them to plant resilience. As some Atacama plants are closely related to staple crops, these candidate PSGs are a ``genetic goldmine'' to engineer crop resilience to face climate change.},

The metabolic and physiological features of CAM represent crucial strategies for survival in hot and dry climates and have been hypothesized to impact hydrogen isotope fractionation. We measured the stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}D, respectively) of individual n-alkanes in 20 species of succulent plants from a global collection of the Huntington Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Greenhouse conditions and irrigation with water of constant {$\delta$}D value enabled determination of interspecies differences in net D/H fractionation between source water and leaf wax products. Carbon isotope ratios provide constraints on the extent of CAM vs. C3 photosynthesis and indicate a wide range of CAM use, with {$\delta$}13C values ranging from -33.01\textperthousand{} to -18.54\textperthousand{} (C27\textendash C33 n-alkanes) and -26.66\textperthousand{} to -17.64\textperthousand{} (bulk tissue). Despite the controlled growth environment, we observed ca. 90\textperthousand{} interspecies range in {$\delta$}D values from -193\textperthousand{} to -107\textperthousand. A positive correlation between {$\delta$}13Cbulk and {$\delta$}DC31 values with R2=0.60 ({$\delta$}13CC31 and {$\delta$}DC31 values with R2=0.41) implicates a metabolic isotope effect as the dominant cause of interspecies variation in the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf wax n-alkanes in CAM-intermediate plants.},

Cataloging the variation in leaf wax traits between species and across environmental gradients may contribute to the understanding of plant functional processes in modern ecosystems, as well as to calibration efforts supporting reconstruction of past ecosystems and environments from the sedimentary archives of leaf wax biomarkers. Towards these goals, we have surveyed the distributions of leaf wax n-alkanes in trees from the lowland tropical rainforest (TR) and montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Per\'u. Molecular abundances were quantified via gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for 632 individuals, 152 species, 99 genera and 51 families across 9 forest plots spanning 0.2\textendash 3.6km elevation. We found the expected abundance distributions; for example, they were dominated by long chain, odd numbered n-alkanes, especially C29 and C31. New observations included a tendency to increasing total alkane concentration at higher elevation. We propose that the well known leaf economic strategy to increase leaf mass per unit area with elevation, provides a theoretical basis for understanding the increase in leaf wax n-alkane abundance with elevation: we infer an increased investment in foliar defense associated with increased leaf lifespan and in response to environmental pressures including cloud immersion and declining temperature. Furthermore, we combined measurements of n-alkane concentration with estimates of forest productivity to provide new ways to quantify ecosystem-scale forest alkane productivity. We introduce a new concept of n-alkane net primary productivity (NPPalk; the product of alkane concentration and leaf NPP) and find that alkane productivity estimates range from 300 to 5000g C/ha/yr, associated with ecological and environmental changes across the elevation profile.},

Comparison of the {$\delta$}Dwax record with a 19-kyr {$\delta$}D record from the nearby Illimani ice core supports the interpretation that precipitation {$\delta$}D is the primary control on {$\delta$}Dwax with a lesser but significant role for local evapotranspiration and other secondary influences on {$\delta$}Dwax. The Titicaca {$\delta$}Dwax record confirms overall wetter conditions in the Central Andes during the last glacial period relative to a drier Holocene. During the last deglaciation, abrupt {$\delta$}Dwax shifts correspond to millennial-scale events observed in the high-latitude North Atlantic, with dry conditions corresponding to the B\o lling\textendash Aller\o d and early Holocene periods and wetter conditions during late glacial and Younger Dryas intervals. We observe a trend of increasing monsoonal precipitation from the early to the late Holocene, consistent with summer insolation forcing of the SASM, but similar hydrologic variability on precessional timescales is not apparent during the last glacial period. Overall, this study demonstrates the relative importance of high-latitude versus tropical forcing as a dominant control on glacial SASM precipitation variability.},

  abstract = {Lacustrine sediments have the potential to preserve paleoenvironmental proxies such as terrestrial plant waxes at high temporal resolution. The temporal fidelity of plant wax records, however, can be up to several thousand years older than the corresponding sediment, based on compound-specific radiocarbon (14C) analysis. Unfortunately, the factors controlling 14C age offsets between plant waxes and sediments are not well understood. The aims of this study are to quantify and compare plant wax n-alkane 14C age offsets among lakes within the same region, and to determine if drainage and lake basin differences (e.g., size, relief, drainage basin morphology, fluvial inputs) influence these offsets. We collected sediments from five lakes in the Adirondack Mountains, NY, USA that lack petrogenic sources of n-alkanes, and range in drainage basin characteristics. Sediment age models were constructed for each lake using a combination of sediment 210Pb, 137Cs, and macrofossil 14C ages, and compared to 14C ages of long-chain (n-C27, n-C29, n-C31) alkanes sampled from Holocene and Late Glacial aged sediments. The n-alkane 14C ageinitial is a measure of the age offset in n-alkanes relative to the sediment they are deposited in. Across all lakes, the n-alkane 14C ageinitial ranged from penecontemporaneous to 2440 14C yr. This oldest n-alkane 14C ageinitial is significantly outside the distribution of all other samples; when excluded, the overall mean n-alkane 14C ageinitial was 400\,{$\pm$}\,255 14C yr (n\,=\,23). The largest n-alkane 14C ageinitial values were observed in the last 1\,cal kyr BP (565\,{$\pm$}\,180 14C yr (1{$\sigma$}), n\,=\,12)) compared to sediments deposited between 1 and 13\,cal kyr BP (220\,{$\pm$}\,195 14C yr (1{$\sigma$}), n\,=\,11)). These age offsets develop early after initial lake basin sedimentation and follow a similar pattern in all of the lakes despite differences in lake basin and catchment size, relief, and geomorphology. We speculate that 14C age offsets occur due to reworking of older n-alkanes stored in drainage basin sediments and soils and this mechanism is most effective in the last {$\sim$}1 kyr. Regardless, lakes in temperate forested metamorphic bedrock terrains have relatively small and stable n-alkane age offsets compared with lakes with extensive catchment soils or anthropogenic disturbance. By targeting lakes with minimal catchment soils, age offsets may be reduced, thereby minimizing attenuation or age distortion of climate signals in plant wax isotopic records.},

However sedimentary waxes accumulate from diverse sources, integrating uncertainties from: (i) variable isotope fractionation among plant species, and (ii) unresolved processes controlling the transport of waxes from plants to sediments. We address these uncertainties by comparing the molecular and isotopic composition of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids in recent bog sediments with all major plant species growing in the catchment of Browns Lake Bog (BLB) in Ohio, USA. There are two distinct plant assemblages at BLB, including a forest dominated by trees and a bog shoreline composed of shrubs, woody groundcover, herbs and graminoids. n-Alkane concentrations in trees were 10\textendash 300 times higher than in shoreline plants, while n-alkanoic acid concentrations were generally lower and comparable across all species. The overall range of wax {$\delta$}2H values among individual plants (77\textperthousand{} for n-C29 alkane and 84\textperthousand{} for n-C28 alkanoic acid) was likely driven by interspecies differences in biosynthetic {$\delta$}2H fractionation as well as source water differences between forest and shoreline plants. A considerably smaller range of {$\delta$}2Hwax values in the bog sediments (9\textperthousand{} for n-C29 alkane and 11\textperthousand{} for n-C28 alkanoic acid) suggests that sediments are either biased toward specific plants, or that signal averaging processes during or after deposition are constant. The combined {$\delta$}2H and {$\delta$}13C signatures of plant sources and sediments indicate a sediment bias mainly toward trees, with contributions from woody shrubs and groundcover growing in the bog shoreline. Within trees and woody shrubs, we observed {$\delta$}2Hwax\textendash{$\delta$}13Cwax relationships of opposite sign for n-C29 alkane and n-C28 alkanoic acid, which we speculate may reflect contrasting seasonal timing of synthesis and plant metabolic status between compound classes. The net apparent {$\delta$}2H fractionation between precipitation and wax ({$\epsilon$}app) was approximately 30\textperthousand{} larger for n-alkanes (-133\textperthousand ) than for n-alkanoic acids (-103\textperthousand ), both at the plant level and in sediments. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of sediments in a hydrologically closed basin to woody plants growing in the associated catchment and can guide {$\epsilon$}app estimates for sedimentary records from similar depositional settings.},

Here we discuss new meteorological data for the foggiest season (July\textendash August\textendash September, JAS) in 2018 and 2019. Our meteorological stations lie between 750 and 1211~m a.~s.~l. at two sites within the Cordillera de la Costa in the hyperarid Atacama (20\textdegree{} S): Cerro Oyarbide and Alto Patache. The data show steep spatial gradients together with rapid changes in the low atmosphere linked to the advection of contrasting coastal (humid and cold) and continental (dry and warm) air masses. One main implication is that fog presence and fog water yields tend to be negatively related to both distance to the coast and elevation. Strong afternoon SW winds advect moisture inland, which take the form of fog in only about 6\% of the JAS at 1211~m a.~s.~l., but 65\% at 750~m a.~s.~l. on the coastal cliff. Although sporadic, long lasting fog events embrace well-mixed marine boundary layer conditions and thick fog cloud between 750 and 1211~m a.~s.~l. These fog events are thought to be the main source of water for the Tillandsia ecosystems and relate their geographic distribution to the lowest fog water yields recorded. Future climate trends may leave fog-dependent Tillandsia even less exposed to the already infrequent fog resulting in rapid vegetation decline.},

  abstract = {Trees and shrubs in tropical Africa use the C3 cycle as a carbon fixation pathway during photosynthesis, while grasses and sedges mostly use the C4 cycle. Leaf-wax lipids from sedimentary archives such as the long-chain n-alkanes (e.g., n-C27 to n-C33) inherit carbon isotope ratios that are representative of the carbon fixation pathway. Therefore, n-alkane {$\delta$}13C values are often used to reconstruct past C3/C4 composition of vegetation, assuming that the relative proportions of C3 and C4 leaf waxes reflect the relative proportions of C3 and C4 plants. We have compared the {$\delta$}13C values of n-alkanes from modern C3 and C4 plants with previously published values from recent lake sediments and provide a framework for estimating the fractional contribution (areal-based) of C3 vegetation cover (fC3) represented by these sedimentary archives. Samples were collected in Cameroon, across a latitudinal transect that accommodates a wide range of climate zones and vegetation types, as reflected in the progressive northward replacement of C3-dominated rain forest by C4-dominated savanna. The C3 plants analysed were characterised by substantially higher abundances of n-C29 alkanes and by substantially lower abundances of n-C33 alkanes than the C4 plants. Furthermore, the sedimentary {$\delta$}13C values of n-C29 and n-C31 alkanes from recent lake sediments in Cameroon (-37.4\textperthousand{} to -26.5\textperthousand ) were generally within the range of {$\delta$}13C values for C3 plants, even when from sites where C4 plants dominated the catchment vegetation. In such cases simple linear mixing models fail to accurately reconstruct the relative proportions of C3 and C4 vegetation cover when using the {$\delta$}13C values of sedimentary n-alkanes, overestimating the proportion of C3 vegetation, likely as a consequence of the differences in plant wax production, preservation, transport, and/or deposition between C3 and C4 plants. We therefore tested a set of non-linear binary mixing models using {$\delta$}13C values from both C3 and C4 vegetation as end-members. The non-linear models included a sigmoid function (sine-squared) that describes small variations in the fC3 values as the minimum and maximum {$\delta$}13C values are approached, and a hyperbolic function that takes into account the differences between C3 and C4 plants discussed above. Model fitting and the estimation of uncertainties were completed using the Monte Carlo algorithm and can be improved by future data addition. Models that provided the best fit with the observed {$\delta$}13C values of sedimentary n-alkanes were either hyperbolic functions or a combination of hyperbolic and sine-squared functions. Such non-linear models may be used to convert {$\delta$}13C measurements on sedimentary n-alkanes directly into reconstructions of C3 vegetation cover.},

  abstract = {The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert possesses important reserves of ``fossil'' or ancient groundwater, yet the extent and timing of past hydrologic change during the late Quaternary is largely unknown. In situ and/or short-distance transported leaf-litter deposits abound along relict fluvial terraces inserted within four dry and unvegetated valleys that drain into the endorheic basin of Pampa del Tamarugal (PDT, 21\textdegree S, 900\textendash 1000 m), one of the largest and economically important aquifers in northern Chile. Our exceptional archive offers the opportunity to evaluate the response of low-elevation desert ecological and hydrological systems to late Quaternary climate variability. Three repeated expansions of riparian/wetland ecosystems, and perennial rivers occurred along the southernmost PDT basin between 17.6\textendash 14.2 ka, 12.1\textendash 11.4 ka and from 1.01\textendash 0.71 ka. Both early and late archaic archaeological artefact are present in clear association with our fossil riparian/wetland assemblages, which suggests that these palaeoenvironmental changes facilitated past human occupations in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. Using modern analogues, we estimate that these ecological and hydrological changes were triggered by a threefold increase in rainfall along the headwaters of what are presently inactive canyons. Comparisons with other regional palaeoclimatic records from the central Andes indicate that these changes were synchronous with the widespread pluvial stages now termed the Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE\textemdash{} 17.5\textendash 14.2 ka and 13.8\textendash 9.7 ka). In addition, we summarize new evidence for perennial runoff, riparian ecosystems and a major human settlement during the latest Holocene. Our findings clearly show that local hydrological changes in the PDT were coupled with precipitation variability in the adjacent eastern highlands during the late Quaternary. The long-term dynamics of low-elevation desert ecological and hydrological systems are likely driven by changes in moisture sources, with one source tied to the Amazon region (N\textendash NE mode) and the other to the Gran Chaco region (SE mode). We conclude by linking ENSO-like variability and moisture variations over the Gran Chaco to the three major regional-scale recharge events over the last 18 ka in the PDT basin. We conclude by asserting that an important portion of the groundwater resources in the PDT is indeed fossil, inherited from past pluvial events. We recommend that the relationship between ancient recharge, together with palaeoclimate records of past headwater rainfall fluctuations should be incorporated into future water-balance models and evaluation of groundwater potential in northern Chile.},

Evidence of Paleoindian habitation is still missing, even though there is no evidence for environmental prohibitors during lateglacial time. The early Archaic hunters (10,820 yr B.P.-ca. 8500 yr B.P.) inhabited the Altiplano (high Puna) and its western slope, where water was available due to higher river runoff from the Altiplano, and the resources in different elevation zones were accessible. Natural resources decreased significantly during the middle Archaic period (8500-ca. 5000 yr B.P.). Lakes receded to today's levels, pedogenesis in the Altiplano terminated, and human activities were restricted to the most stable sites in the R\'io Lao and the R\'io Purifica catchments north of 23\textdegree S. The less stable oases south of 23\textdegree S (Salar de Atacama and Punta Negra) were abandoned.

  abstract = {The question whether the mid-Holocene climate (between ca. 9 and 4 cal kyr B.P.) in the Atacama Desert and the Central Andes in general was humid or dry has wide implications with regard to the understanding of long-term climate variability in South America. Paleosols, regional groundwater tables, abiotic proxy data and pollen of aquatic plants in lake sediments show a marked and rapid shift from very humid late-glacial/early Holocene climatic conditions (between ca. 14 and 9.5 kyr B.P.) to extremely dry mid-Holocene conditions (more arid than today between ca. 9 and 4 kyr B.P.). An exception during this hyperarid period is a century-scale more humid interval around ca. 5.5\textendash 6 kyr B.P. that appears systematically in lake sediment archives. In contrast, pollen for most terrestrial plants preserved in lake sediments do not show major changes during the Holocene, whereas more humid mid-Holocene conditions (compared with late Holocene conditions) were inferred from plant macrofossils in rodent middens. Is the reason for this disagreement to be attributed to misinterpretation of the paleoenvironments or of the proxy records themselves, or to incomplete paleoclimatic interpretation of the paleoenvironments? We argue that these different paleoclimate archives record different aspects and facets of `climate'. While paleosols and groundwater in the Atacama Desert record low-frequency climate variability at century to millennium scales, lake sediments on the Altiplano record decade- to century-scale variability. Terrestrial vegetation responds to shorter high-frequency climate variability at seasonal to inter-annual scales and preferably to humid years. Vegetation remains in `hibernation' or does not germinate during arid years. Thus information from these three types of archives is not a priori comparable and requires careful site-specific, archive-specific and time-scale-specific evaluation. What is natural in modern climatology is also true for paleoclimatology: a comprehensive assessment must account for the complex daily and seasonal cycles, for the range of climate variability and trends at different scales in space and time, for impacts of short-term extreme events, and for specific, often non-linear responses of individual bio-geo-physical archives to any of the numerous aspects of `climate'.},

In 4-year-old plants of one clone planted out at a Swiss plateau and alpine sites, changes in wax structure were similar to those found in mature trees.

We reviewed studies of adaptation along elevation gradients (i) from a meta-analysis of phenotypic differentiation of three traits (height, biomass and phenology) from plants growing in 70 common garden experiments; (ii) by testing elevation adaptation using three fitness proxies (survival, reproductive output and biomass) from 14 reciprocal transplant experiments; (iii) by qualitatively assessing information at the molecular level, from 10 genomewide surveys and candidate gene approaches. We found that plants originating from high elevations were generally shorter and produced less biomass, but phenology did not vary consistently. We found significant evidence for elevation adaptation in terms of survival and biomass, but not for reproductive output. Variation in phenotypic and fitness responses to elevation across species was not related to life history traits or to environmental conditions. Molecular studies, which have focussed mainly on loci related to plant physiology and phenology, also provide evidence for adaptation along elevation gradients. Together, these studies indicate that genetically based trait differentiation and adaptation to elevation are widespread in plants. We conclude that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying adaptation, not only to elevation but also to environmental change, will require more studies combining the ecological and molecular approaches.},

Precipitation between 15\textdegree{} and 27 \textdegree S is dominated by summer convective activity from Amazonia, and data analysis shows that the increase in precipitation with elevation due to the rainshadow effect best fits an exponential correlation. Coupling with limited data from high elevations suggests that the correlation is accurate to 4500 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) and perhaps to 5500 m a.s.l., suggesting that increased precipitation goes unrecorded over the peaks of the western Cordillera. South of 27 \textdegree S the precipitation is dominated by winter frontal sources and shows no well-defined relationship with elevation. The core zone of hyper-aridity in the Atacama Desert extends from 15 to 30 \textdegree S at elevations from sea level to 3500 m a.s.l. Although the Atacama Desert has existed since at least 90 Ma, it is considered that the initial onset of hyper-aridity was most likely to have developed progressively with the uplift of the Andes as they reached elevations between 1000 to 2000 m a.s.l. coupled with the intensification of a cold, upwelling Peruvian Current between 15 and 10 Ma. Also apparent in the palaeogeographic record are subsequent fluctuations between (semi-) arid to hyper-arid conditions that were probably largely controlled by changes in orbital and oceanic forcing.

The dynamic nature of these weather systems implies that the position of the ADD is not stable over seasonal and longer periods. Climates currently found either north or south of the ADD may in the past have been displaced, intensified or weakened leading to changes in the position of the ADD. For example, along the coastal regions of Peru and Chile, El Ni\~no currently modulates both winter and summer precipitation. Flood episodes caused by these precipitation events are manifested in sedimentary and other natural archives that have been used to reconstruct past climates, yet have at times, produced contradictory interpretations. The realization that ENSO has varying `flavours' that are spatially distinct and associated with a mobile ADD may allow a more sophisticated approach to paleoclimate research that has the potential to resolve some of these difficulties.},

  abstract = {Leaf wax n-alkanes provide a valuable palaeoecological proxy, but their interpretation requires an understanding of the scale of temporal and spatial integration in soils. Leaf wax n-alkanes are continually deposited into soils directly from local plants as well as from more distant plants via wind or water transport. In addition, n-alkanes can persist in soils for thousands of years, and tend to decrease in age with shallower depth. To explore whether the uppermost soils reflect recent leaf fall inputs we compared surface soils and modern vegetation from 20 sites along a transect across Australia. At each site, the three most dominant plant species and a soil sample from the top 3\,cm were analysed for n-alkane concentration, average chain length (ACL), proportional abundance of C33 and C29 (Norm33) and carbon preference index (CPI). Chain length distributions differ between trees and grasses, with a higher proportion of C29 in trees and C33 in grasses. Norm33 in soils correlates with proportional grass to tree cover across the transect. To model n-alkane inputs for each site, we calculated a predicted ACL, Norm33 and CPI using the dominant plants at that site, weighted by proportional species cover and n-alkane concentration. Predicted ACL, Norm33 and CPI inputs were generally higher than the soils, demonstrating that recent and local inputs do not dominate soil n-alkanes at our study sites. Thus, n-alkane distributions in surface soils do not correlate with local, current vegetation, but do correlate with proportional grass and tree cover, suggesting they provide a faithful record of large scale ecosystem structure.},

Here, we review new or recently improved biomarker approaches for reconstructing: (i) physical climate variables (land temperature, rainfall), (ii) ecosystem state variables (vegetation, fire regime), and (iii) biogeochemical variables (soil residence time, methane cycling). This review encompasses a range of key compound classes (e.g., lipids, lignin, and carbohydrates). In each section, we explore the concept behind key biomarker approaches and discuss their successes as paleoenvironmental indicators.

If the straight-chain lipid composition in plant leaves and roots is specific enough to allow distinction, their records in soils and peat bogs might be used for this purpose. We tested for such distinctiveness by analyzing the n-alkane, n-alcohol, n-aldehyde and wax ester composition in lipid extracts from the leaves and roots of the 19 plant species responsible for the dominant biomass input into soils and peat bogs along two altitudinal transects in the Ecuadorian Andes. We found the combined n-alkane and n-alcohol composition of the leaves of the studied plants to be unique enough in theory to allow for a distinction of the various plant species. The extractable straight-chain lipid concentrations in the roots were generally much lower than in the leaves of the same species, and were in many cases less specific. The n-fatty acids, n-aldehydes and wax ester compositions in leaves as well as roots appeared to be less suited as biomarkers, due to a lower specificity of the n-fatty acids and the absence of the n-aldehydes and wax ester from a significant number of plant species. Furthermore, using cluster analysis we found the combination of n-alkanes and n-alcohols from leaves to give the most meaningful clustering from the point of view of an UFL reconstruction, with all but one p\'aramo grassland species and all but one peat bog species clustering separately from forest species. In addition, a large C31/C27 n-alkane ratio as well as a large C26/C30 n-alcohol ratio were found to be indicative of p\'aramo vegetation (grasses). Both clustering and ratios can help reconstruct past UFL positions if discerning individual species from soil or peat records proves unfeasible. The preservation of the straight-chain lipid signal was tested in soil and peat samples from the study area predating 4910{$\pm$}40 14C years B.P. and 2110{$\pm$}40 14C years B.P., respectively, and found to be excellent.},

Variable pollen assemblages prevailed from 390 to 90 BP, followed by a drying trend that persists until present times. Similarities with proxy records from the Altiplano, the tropical Andes and the equatorial Pacific suggest that centennial-scale wet/dry phases in the Atacama highlands were associated with changes in the strength of the South American monsoon system, most likely influenced by changes akin to modern El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation variability.},

  abstract = {The South American summer monsoon (SASM) is the most important climate system of tropical South America, transporting moisture from the tropical Atlantic Ocean to the core of the continent during the austral summer. Recent paleoclimate studies suggest that past variability of the SASM has been more heterogenous in space and time than previously thought, implying that different atmospheric drivers controlled its long-term evolution. Unfortunately, past SASM reconstructions are largely limited to the last 2000 years and mainly focused on the core of the monsoon domain where precipitation does not fall exclusively during the monsoon season, thereby limiting our understanding of its long-term changes, drivers and mechanisms. Here we present a new 4000-year SASM precipitation reconstruction based on a high-resolution pollen sequence from a mountain lake in the dry Andes of northern Chile (21\textdegree S). We provide evidence for two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced SASM precipitation between 4000\textendash 3400 and 2300-1900~cal~yr BP. These intervals are replicated in records from the southern portion of the central Andes ({$>$}18\textdegree S) but not clearly detected further north, suggesting the existence of a monsoon dynamics largely decoupled from latitudinal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A comparison with precipitation reconstructions from the entire SASM domain and modern climate datasets suggests a teleconnection with the Southern Hemisphere circulation through the intensification of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone and/or the intrusion of extra-tropical Atlantic moisture. Our results highlight that significant spatial and temporal variability of the SASM occurred during the most recent millennia, and therefore social and environmental forecast should consider that similar variations will likely occur in the future.},

Ketones, secondary alcohols, diols, aldehydes, terpenes and flavones are also found. The major function of the wax appears to be protection of the organism from water loss and other hazards of the environment. The alkanes are formed from fatty acids either by elongation followed by decarboxylation or by head-to-head condensation between two biochemically dissimilar fatty acids followed by specific decarboxylation of one of them. Fatty acyl-CoA is reduced to the aldehyde which in turn is reduced to the alcohol. The alcohol is then esterified with acyl moieties from acyl-CoA or phospholipids. Plant waxes undergo very little catabolism in plants but animals can degrade them to a limited extent and microorganisms readily degrade them.},

  abstract = {The Earth has gone through multiple ice ages in the past million years. Understanding the ice age dynamics is crucial to paleoclimatic study, and is helpful for addressing future climate challenges. Though ice ages are paced by variations in Earth's orbit geometry, how various climatic system components on the Earth respond to insolation forcing and interact with each other remains unclear. A prevailing view argues that the initial responses occur in the northern high latitudes (i.e. the northern high-latitude hypothesis, NHH). This opinion is challenged by recent reports, such as the lead of climate change in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) relative to that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the southern control on Atlantic meridional overturning circulations (AMOC), and the potential significance of Southern Hemisphere (SH). Alternatively, the tropical hypothesis (TH) argues for a leading role of the tropics. Both the NHH and the TH belong to a single-forcing mechanism, and have difficulty in interpreting phenomena, such as the saw-tooth pattern of the ice ages. Here we present a new proposal concerning the Earth's ice age dynamics: the bimodal forcing hypothesis (BFH). The essential assumption of this hypothesis is that for glacial-interglacial cycles, the cooling (glaciation) starts from the northern high latitudes, whereas the warming (deglaciations) starts from the SH. Particularly, the BFH emphasizes the significance of SH oceans in accumulating and transferring heat for deglaciations. Thus, it is capable to reasonably explain the saw-tooth pattern. We compiled 100 paleotemperature records globally for validation. The BFH is consistent with most of these records, and provides a straightforward and comprehensible way to interpret ice age on Earth.},

The midden sites are along the hyperarid upper margin (2400\textendash 3100 m) of the ``absolute desert,'' in an extreme environment sparsely vegetated by annual herbs and halophytic shrubs. Conditions between 40 and 22 ka may have been at least intermittently dry, and possibly cooler, as implied by four middens with low species richness. We infer a large increase in summer rainfall between 16.2 and 10.5 ka on the basis of the lowering of steppe grasses by as much as 1000 m, prominence of C4 grasses and summer annuals, high species richness, and displacement of northern species at least 50 km south of their modern ranges. The precipitation increase was greatest for a cluster of middens between 11.8 and 10.5 ka. Abrupt drying, evident in a dramatic decrease in grass abundance, occurred after 10.5 ka at all four midden localities. Increased percentages of grass, higher species richness, and extralocal taxa record slightly wetter conditions between 7.1 and 3.5 ka. The present hyperarid conditions were established after 3 ka.Present-day variability of summer precipitation in the central Atacama Desert and adjacent Altiplano is related to the intensity and position of upper air circulation anomalies, which in turn respond to Pacific sea-surface temperature anomalies. Summer insolation over the central Andes (lat 20\textdegree S) was at its minimum during the latest glacial to early Holocene transition, so regional insolation forcing cannot account for intensified pluvial conditions in the central Atacama. Summer precipitation collapsed abruptly between 10.5 and 10 ka, indicating either nonlinear relationships with seasonal insolation or a change in intensity of upper air circulation over the Altiplano, effectively blocking moisture transport to the Atacama Desert. Here, we suggest that precipitation variations on millennial time scales in the central Atacama are the result of extraregional forcing of the South American Summer Monsoon through intensified Walker Circulation (stronger easterlies) and La Ni\~na\textendash like conditions operating through insolation anomalies (i.e., departures in insolation values) directly over central Asia and the equatorial Pacific.},

  abstract = {1 The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped according to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2 We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem functioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assemblages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3 To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4 We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5 This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exercised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental conditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

Here we consider the interactions between pollinators, herbivores, and resource availability in shaping plant local adaptation, how these interactions impact plant phenotypes and gene flow, and the conditions where multiple traits align along major environmental gradients such as latitude and elevation. Continued work in emerging model systems will benefit from the melding of classic experimental approaches with novel population genetic analyses to reveal patterns and processes in plant local adaptation.},

  abstract = {The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) is a climatic perturbation with a core period of 1000-1200 AD that is well-recognized in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Its existence in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the level of synchronicity with the NH is still a matter of debate. Here we present a palaeotemperature synthesis for South America encompassing the past 1500 years based on multiproxy data from 76 published land and marine sites. The data sets have been thoroughly graphically correlated and the MCA trends palaeoclimatologically mapped. The vast majority of all South American land sites suggest a warm MCA. Andean vegetation zones moved upslope, glaciers retreated, biological productivity in high altitude lakes increased, the duration of cold season ice cover on Andean lakes shortened, and trees produced thicker annual rings. Similar MCA warming occurred in coastal seas, except in the year-round upwelling zones of Peru, northern Chile and Cabo Frio (Brazil) where upwelling processes intensified during the MCA due to changes in winds and ocean currents. MCA warming in South America and the NH appears to have occurred largely synchronous, probably reaching comparable intensities. Future studies will have to address major MCA data gaps that still exist outside the Andes in the central and eastern parts of the continent. The most likely key drivers for the medieval climate change are multi-centennial Pacific and Atlantic ocean cycles, probably linked to solar forcing.},

The cuticle creates an effective barrier against water loss, bacterial and fungal infection and also protects plant tissue from UV radiation. It is composed of the cutin matrix and embedded soluble lipids also called waxes. Chemical composition of cuticular waxes and physiological properties of cuticles are affected by internal regulatory mechanisms and environmental conditions (e.g. drought, light, and humidity). Here, we tested the effect of drought stress simulation by the exogenous application of abscisic acid (ABA) on cuticular wax amount and composition. ABA-treated plants and control plants differed in total aboveground biomass, leaf area, stomatal density and aperture, and carbon isotope composition. They did not differ in total wax amount per area but there were peculiar differences in the abundance of particular components. ABA-treated plants contained significantly higher proportions of aliphatic components characterized by chain length larger than C26, compared to control plants. This trend was consistent both between and within different functional groups of wax components. This can lead to a higher hydrophobicity of the cuticular transpiration barrier and thus decrease cuticular water loss in ABA-treated plants. At both ABA-treated and control plants alcohols with chain length C24 and C26 were predominant. Such a shift towards wax compounds having a higher average chain length under drought conditions can be interpreted as an adaptive response of plants towards drought stress.},

While many tools have been made available to researchers to quantify age uncertainties suitable for various settings and assumptions, disparate tools and output formats often discourage integrative approaches. In addition, associated tasks like propagating age-model uncertainties to subsequent analyses, and visualizing the results, have received comparatively little attention in the literature and available software. Here, we describe geoChronR, an open-source R package to facilitate these tasks. geoChronR is built around an emerging data standard (Linked PaleoData, or LiPD) and offers access to four popular age-modeling techniques (Bacon, BChron, OxCal, BAM). The output of these models is used to conduct ensemble data analysis, quantifying the impact of chronological uncertainties on common analyses like correlation, regression, principal component, and spectral analyses by repeating the analysis across a large collection of plausible age models. We present five real-world use cases to illustrate how geoChronR may be used to facilitate these tasks, visualize the results in intuitive ways, and store the results for further analysis, promoting transparency and reusability.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The factors affecting the amounts and types of organic matter in lacustrine sediments are summarized in this review, and synthesis, of published studies. Biota living in the lake and in its watershed are the sources of the organic compounds initially contributed to the lake system. Microbial reworking of these materials during sinking and early sedimentation markedly diminishes the total amount of organic matter while replacing many of the primary compounds with secondary ones. Much of the organic matter content of sediments is the product of this microbial reprocessing. Various organic matter components of lake sediments nonetheless retain source information and thereby contribute to the paleolimnological record. Carbon/nitrogen ratios of total organic matter reflect original proportions of algal and land-derived material. Carbon isotopic compositions indicate the history of lake productivity and carbon recycling. Biomarker compounds provide important information about contributions from different biota. Sterol compositions and chainlength distributions of n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, and n-alkanols help distinguish different algal and watershed sources and also record diagenetic alterations. Stabilization of functional-group-containing biomarkers by conversion into saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons or by incorporation into bound forms improves their preservation and hence record of source information. Lignin components provide important evidence of watershed plant cover, and pigments reflect algal assemblages. The interplay of the factors influencing the organic matter content of lake sediments is illustrated by overviews of sedimentary records of four lake systems\textemdash Lake Biwa (Japan), Lake Greifen (Switzerland), Lake Washington (Pacific Northwest), and the Great Lakes (American Midwest).},

In this regard, this study investigates the spatiotemporal teleconnections between four oceanic oscillations, namely North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), against Peruvian precipitation patterns during the past 25 years (i.e., 1990-2015). For this purpose, variation in the precipitation pattern at monthly and annual scales as well as the~Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series at 1-, 3-, 12-, and 48-month time scales were evaluated at 10 meteorology stations across Peru. Pearson's correlation coefficient and mutual information between the oceanic oscillations and precipitation-born signals were calculated and spatially interpolated using the Kriging method. The results indicated the presence of three major climatic regions in the country. The NAO has the largest correlation with the monthly precipitation. However, the ENSO was found as the main climate driver of extremely wet and extremely dry conditions in the country. The results also demonstrated that the PDO has a higher impact on the annual precipitation pattern, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country.},

Today, vegetation growth is restricted to the Coastal Cordillera and the Andean foothills, which are predominantly supplied by fog or rainfall. The sources of OM in topsoils of hyperarid regions and deep sediments remain an open question; therefore, we hypothesized that desert plants exhibit specific n-alkane compositions that can be traced in adjacent topsoils and assessed possible OM sources and formation processes in hyperarid regions and soil depths of desert. We determined the n-alkane signatures of plants (n\,=\,28), of soil OM in their vicinity, of hyperarid surface sediments (n\,=\,82), and of four depth profiles (up to 200\, cm). We found that n-alkane distributions in fog-fed plants were dominated in order by nC31, nC29, nC33, and nC27 alkanes, while rain-fed plants were dominated by nC29 and nC31 alkanes. When the ratio of nC27+nC33/nC29+nC31 was applied as a ``fog-to-rain n-alkane ratio'', the data in surface soils and sediments below 1200 m a.s.l. (in the west of the desert) indicated fog-influenced formation of organics, while all soils and sediments formed higher than 1200 m a.s.l. (in the center and east of the desert) archived n-alkanes from plants fed by rain. Surprisingly, 75\textendash 98\% of the desert's OM was found in deep sediments, even under recent vegetation cover. Hence, our findings indicate that currently vegetation-free hyperarid regions of the Atacama Desert once varied in size depending on climate change.},

The correlation between volcanic input in Lago Chungar\'a and the total particles deposited in the Nevado Sajama ice core suggests the Parinacota Volcano as the common source. The geochemical record of Lago Chungar\'a indicates an increase in siliceous productivity during the early Holocene, lagging behind the rise in temperatures inferred from the Nevado Sajama ice core.

We ask which species were most and which were least affected by changes in rainfall during the late Quaternary in northernmost Chile. Location Quebrada La Higuera (QLH; 18\textdegree ~S), a shallow canyon that cuts east\textendash west through the western Andean precordillera of northern Chile, connecting the Altiplano with the hyperarid Atacama Desert. Methods We collected and dated 22 rodent middens from elevations of 3100\textendash 3500~m in QLH. These were analysed for identifiable plant macrofossils and pollen. We also measured chinchilla rat (Abrocoma cinerea) faecal pellets in the youngest middens to explore how they relate to past ecological and climatic change. Results The three oldest middens dated to more than 37~ka (thousand calibrated 14C years), four middens dated to 14.4\textendash 11.6~ka, and fifteen middens spanned the last 650~years. During all the intervals examined, extralocal species (those found today at higher elevations and indicative of positive rainfall anomalies) were present at our midden sites. In the youngest interval, Parastrephia pollen (indicating increased rainfall) increased abruptly at ad 1760 and remained high until the mid-1800s. This increase was also seen in our faecal pellet record. Main conclusions Extralocal species were prevalent in late Pleistocene middens at lower elevations when the climate was wetter. When combined with other regional midden records, we postulate that many species found today in the Altiplano were displaced to lower elevations during the late Pleistocene. The recent large-scale mortality documented among arboreal cactus populations along the present upper margins of the Atacama suggests that these are relict populations that are likely to have flourished during a wetter period in the early 1800s.},

These studies, however, have not focused on analyzing the combined influence of the different phases of these teleconnections and the simultaneous influence of these teleconnections at differing time-frequency scales. The present study addresses this issue by exploring the use of wavelet-based methods in combination with non-parametric approaches to analyze individual and combined influences involving ENSO, NAO, and PDO on monthly precipitation and streamflow data from watersheds in Alberta, Ontario, and Newfoundland, in Canada. This study is the first time that multiscale and multivariate analyses of ENSO, NAO, and PDO, along with their different phases, are used to explain the variability of streamflow and precipitation in a watershed. Generally, the positive and negative phases (particularly of ENSO and NAO) were respectively associated with lower and higher precipitation/streamflow, while the neutral phase showed similar behavior to that of the negative phase. The results of the bivariate and multivariate wavelet coherences revealed that there were consistent increases in the average wavelet coherence (AWC) and the percentage of significant coherence (PoSP) for all watersheds, from using only one factor to two and three teleconnection factors. The ranges of AWC for one, two and three factors were 0.31\textendash 0.40, 0.56\textendash 0.66, and 0.77\textendash 0.81, respectively.

This implies that three-factor combinations (ENSO-NAO-PDO) were needed to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds.},

That phenotypic plasticity could be adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral. We manipulated the timing of spring snowmelt and amount of summer precipitation in factorial combination and examined responses of specific leaf area (SLA), trichome density, leaf water content (LWC), photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) in the subalpine herb Ipomopsis aggregata. The experiment was repeated in three years differing in natural timing of snowmelt. To examine natural selection, we used survival, relative growth rate, and flowering as fitness indices. A 50\% reduction in summer precipitation reduced stomatal conductance and increased iWUE, and doubled precipitation increased LWC. Combining natural and experimental variation, earlier snowmelt reduced soil moisture, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, and increased trichome density and iWUE. Precipitation reduction reversed the mortality selection favoring high stomatal conductance under normal and doubled precipitation, and higher LWC improved growth. Earlier snowmelt is a strong signal of climate change and can change expression of leaf morphology and gas exchange traits, just as reduced precipitation can. Stomatal conductance and SLA showed adaptive plasticity under some conditions.},

  abstract = {Surface uplift of large plateaus may significantly influence regional climate and more specifically precipitation patterns and temperature, sometimes complicating paleoaltimetry interpretations. Thus, understanding the topographic evolution of tectonically active mountain belts benefits from continued development of reliable proxies to reduce uncertainties in paleoaltimetry reconstructions. Lipid biomarker-based proxies provide a novel approach to stable isotope paleoaltimetry and complement authigenic or pedogenic mineral proxy materials, in particular outside semi-arid climate zones where soil carbonates are not abundant but (soil) organic matter has a high preservation potential. Here we present {$\delta$}D values of soil-derived n-alkanes and mean annual air temperature (MAT) estimates based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) distributions to assess their potential for paleoelevation reconstructions in the southern central Andes. We analyzed soil samples across two environmental and hydrological gradients that include a hillslope (26\textendash 28\textdegree S) and a valley (22\textendash 24\textdegree S) transect on the windward flanks of Central Andean Eastern Cordillera in NW Argentina. Our results show that present-day n-alkane {$\delta$}D values and brGDGT-based MAT estimates are both linearly related with elevation and in good agreement with present-day climate conditions. Soil n-alkanes show a {$\delta$}D lapse rate ({$\Delta$}({$\delta$}D)) of -1.64\textperthousand/100~m (R2=0.91, p{$<$}0.01) at the hillslope transect, within the range of {$\delta$}D lapse rates from precipitation and surface waters in other tropical regions in the Andes like the Eastern Cordillera in Colombia and Bolivia and the Equatorial and Peruvian Andes. BrGDGT-derived soil temperatures are similar to monitored winter temperatures in the region and show a lapse rate of {$\Delta$}T=-0.51\textdegree C/100~m (R2=0.91, p{$<$}0.01), comparable with lapse rates from in situ soil temperature measurements, satellite-derived land-surface temperatures at this transect, and weather stations from the Eastern Cordillera at similar latitude. As a result of an increasing leeward sampling position along the valley transect lapse rates are biased towards lower values and display higher scatter ({$\Delta$}({$\delta$}D)=-0.95\textperthousand/100~m, R2=0.76, p{$<$}0.01 and {$\Delta$}T=-0.19\textdegree C/100~m, R2=0.48, p{$<$}0.05). Despite this higher complexity, they are in line with lapse rates from stream-water samples and in situ soil temperature measurements along the same transect. Our results demonstrate that both soil n-alkane {$\delta$}D values and MAT reconstructions based on brGDGTs distributions from the hillslope transect ({$\Delta$}({$\delta$}D)=-1.64\textperthousand/100~m, R2=0.91, p{$<$}0.01 and {$\Delta$}T=-0.51\textdegree C/100~m, R2=0.91, p{$<$}0.01) track the direct effects of orography on precipitation and temperature and hence the combined effects of local and regional hydrology as well as elevation.},

Cessation of the use of the sites between 9500 and 4500 cal yr B.P. is associated with drying of the lakes. The mid-Holocene collapse of human occupation is also recorded in cave deposits.

One problem is that an abrupt increase in the AMOC during the B\o lling-Aller\o d (BA) transition occurred when the melting of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets was significant, which tended to weaken the AMOC. Here, from transient simulations of the last deglaciation using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, we show that an abrupt increase in the AMOC during the BA transition could occur without reduction in glacial meltwater. The abrupt increase in the AMOC accompanied abrupt warming in Greenland and sea ice retreat in the North Atlantic, consistent with proxies and previous modeling studies. The results imply that abrupt BA warming during the middle stage of the last deglaciation was a response to gradual warming under the presence of meltwater from continental ice sheets.},

  abstract = {The hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert is one of the most persistently arid environments in the world, yet there is evidence of significant hydroclimate variability during the Holocene. The timing of regional scale pluvial or humid periods has important implications for understanding the drivers of South American climate variability as well as the development of agriculture by prehistoric cultures. Here we present oxygen ({$\delta$}18O) and carbon ({$\delta$}13C) isotope values from ancient Prosopis sp. tree-ring cellulose as a record relative humidity (RH) and water availability (via intrinsic water\textendash use efficiency) over century\textendash long intervals throughout the past 9.5 ka in the northern Atacama Desert (19\textendash 21\textdegree S). These data provide the first high\textendash resolution (ca. annual) evidence for decreasing water availability and increasing climate variability in the Atacama from the early-to late- Holocene. Intrinsic water\textendash use efficiency steadily increases over the Holocene indicating a lowering of the water table and a reduction in the availability of groundwater resources in the region. As water availability decreases, {$\delta$}18O-based estimates of RH show increased variance beginning \textasciitilde 4.9 ka. This change in RH coincides with the onset of modern day Central Andean atmospheric circulation patterns and previously documented humid periods in the southern Altiplano (22\textendash 24\textdegree S). Subannual tree-ring isotope analysis of modern and early Holocene (8.3 ka) trees show a similar seasonal cycle in carbon isotope values that correlates with modern annual changes in temperature; however, the early Holocene interseasonal variability is greater than modern seasonality. {$\delta$}18O values of the Atacama tree-rings are highly correlated with those of the Sajama ice core from the Bolivian Andes, demonstrating a teleconnection between high-altitude Andean precipitation and water availability in the Atacama Desert. These reconstructions together provide a record of Holocene water availability and ephemeral recharge related to changes in ENSO and South American monsoon.},

These are regularly analyzed from marine and lake sediments and even more frequently in archaeological contexts, enabling the reconstruction of past environments in direct association with records of past human behavior. Carbon and hydrogen isotope measurements of these compounds are used to trace plant type and water-use efficiency, relative paleotemperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration of leaf and soil moisture, and other physiological and ecological parameters. Plant wax lipids have great potential for answering questions related to human-environment interactions, being for the most part chemically inert and easily recoverable in terrestrial sediments, including those dating back millions of years. The growing use of this technique, and comparison of such data with other paleoenvironmental proxies such as pollen and phytolith analysis and soil carbonate and tooth enamel isotope records, make it essential to establish consistent, best-practice protocols for extracting n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids from archaeological sediments to provide comparable information for interpreting past climatic, ecosystem, and hydrological changes and their interaction with human societies. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors.

Biomarker research is generating new and exciting information on the ecological context in which Homo and its closest relatives evolved, adapted, and invented stone tool technologies. In this review, we examine plant wax biomarkers and their use in reconstructing past plant landscapes and hydroclimates.

The absence of flood deposits from 11 to 3 ka points to exceptionally dry and virtually ice-free conditions in the Andes between 28\textendash 34\textdegree S. The floods were probably caused by major rainfall or dammed-lake outbursts clustered largely during wet pluvial periods in the otherwise moisture-limited central Andes and Atacama Desert, such as when the Intertropical Convergence Zone was shifted southward.

We mapped and dated these paleowetland deposits at three presently waterless locations near Salar de Punta Negra (24.5\textdegree S) on the western slope of the Andes. Elevated groundwater levels supported phreatic discharge into wetlands during two periods: 15,900 to \textasciitilde{} 13,800 and 12,700 to \textasciitilde{} 9700 cal yr BP. Dense concentrations of lithic artifacts testify to the presence of paleoindians around the wetlands late in the second wet phase (11,000?\textendash 9700 cal yr BP). Water tables dropped below the surface before 15,900 and since 8100 cal yr BP, and briefly between \textasciitilde{} 13,800 and 12,700 cal yr BP. This temporal pattern is repeated, with some slight differences, in rodent middens from the study area, in both paleowetland and rodent midden deposits north and south of the study area, and in lake level fluctuations on the adjacent Bolivian Altiplano. The regional synchroneity of these changes points to a strengthening of the South American Monsoon \textemdash{} which we term the "Central Andean Pluvial Event" \textemdash{} in two distinct intervals (15,900\textendash 13,800 and 12,700\textendash 9700 cal yr BP), probably induced by steepened SST gradients across the tropical Pacific (i.e., La Ni\~na-like conditions).},

On the 15 proglacial margins studied, we identified a system of ten principal moraines that marks the successive positions of glaciers over the last four centuries. Moraines were dated by performing statistical analysis of lichen measurements based on the extreme values theory. Like glaciers in many mid-latitude mountain areas, Bolivian glaciers reached their maximal extent during the second half of the 17th century. This glacier maximum coincides with the Maunder minimum of solar irradiance. By reconstructing the equilibrium-line altitude and changes in mass-balance, we think the glacier maximum may be due to a 20 to 30\% increase in precipitation and a 1.1 to 1.2~\textdegree C decrease in temperature compared with present conditions. In the early 18th century, glaciers started to retreat at varying rates until the late 19th to early 20th century; this trend was generally associated with decreasing accumulation rates. By contrast, glacier recession in the 20th century was mainly the consequence of an increase in temperature and humidity. These results are consistent with observations made in the study region based on other proxies.},

A lichenometric method using the Rhizocarpon geographicum was used to date the moraines and reconstruct the main glacier fluctuations over the period. The maximum glacier extent occurred in the second half of the 17th century, followed by nearly continuous retreat with three interruptions during the 18th and the 19th centuries, marked by stabilisation or minor advances. Results obtained in the Charquini area are first compared with other dating performed in the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca and then with the fluctuations of documented glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. Glacier fluctuations along the tropical Andes (Bolivia and Peru) were in phase during the LIA and the solar forcing appears to be important during the period of glacier advance. Compared with the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, the major advance observed on these glaciers during the first half of the 19th century is not present in the tropical Andes. This discrepancy may be due to regional scale climate variations. To cite this article: A. Rabatel et al., C. R. Geoscience 337 (2005).},

  abstract = {Sedimentary lipid biomarker proxies are extensively used for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental research. Among all the lipid compounds, the non-polar n-alkanes (chain lengths n-C14 to n-C37) are one of the most widely used lipid fractions for such studies. However, the lack of optimized automated extraction and post-extraction sample workup procedure, using conventional polar solvent, from environmental samples, has been challenging. Conversely, extraction of the n-alkanes using non-polar solvents restricts the co-extraction of other polar lipid compounds like ketones, alcohols, acids, etc. which may be of interest to many researchers. Here we report an optimized total lipid extraction method using the conventional polar dichloromethane/methanol solvents with standardized Automated Solvent Extractor (ASE) parameters and post-extraction sample work-up protocols. The robustness of the method has been tested by extracting eight samples containing algae, leaf, and sediment/rock of varying age (spanning from recent to {$\sim$}252 Ma). The results of the extraction efficiency (yield) of the method were compared with commonly used methods, those using either non-polar n-hexane or polar dichloromethane/methanol solvents. For n-alkane extraction from algal biomass, the performance of the proposed method and the conventional polar solvent method are statistically comparable, but the new method performs better than the non-polar solvent method. Likewise, for the leaf and sediment samples, the performance of the proposed method is equivalent to the non-polar solvent method but outperforms the commonly used polar solvent method. The Terrestrial Aquatic Ratio (TAR) and long-chain hydrocarbon/short-chain hydrocarbon (LHC/SHC) ratios calculated from the algae and sediment samples also show that our recommended extraction approach can be confidently used in calculating n-alkane ratio proxies, which critically depend on the extraction efficiency of the short-chain n-alkanes Taken together, the new method will be highly useful for studying the n-alkanes from a wide spectrum of natural sample matrices and provide reliable data for paleoclimatic inference.},

Here we use soil morphological characteristics, salt chemistry, and mass independent fractionation anomalies ({$\Delta$}17O values) in dated paleosols to reconstruct a middle Miocene climatic transition from semiaridity to extreme hyperaridity in the Atacama Desert. Paleosols along the southeastern margin of the Calama Basin change from calcic Vertisols with root traces, slickensides, and gleyed horizons to an extremely mature salic Gypsisol with pedogenic nitrate. We interpret this transition, which occurred between 19 and 13 Ma, to represent a change in precipitation from \&gt;200 mm/yr to \&lt;20 mm/yr. This drastic reduction in precipitation likely resulted from uplift of the Central Andes to elevations \&gt;2 km; the uplift blocked moisture from the South American summer monsoon from entering the Atacama. The mid-Miocene Gypsisol with pedogenic nitrate is located at elevations between 2900 and 3400 m in the Calama Basin, significantly higher than modern nitrate soils, which occur below {$\sim$}2500 m. Modern and Quaternary soils in this elevation zone contain soil carbonate and lack pedogenic gypsum and nitrate. We infer that \&gt;900 m of local surface uplift over the past 10 m.y. displaced these nitrate paleosols relative to modern nitrate soils and caused a return to wetter conditions in the Calama Basin by decreasing local air temperatures and creating an orographic barrier to Pacific air masses.},

  abstract = {During the middle Holocene (8\textendash 3 ka), wetland deposits accumulated in areas with emergent water tables in the central Atacama Desert (22\textendash 24\textdegree S), producing a stratigraphic unit (Unit C) that can be mapped and correlated across different basins and geomorphic settings. Wherever mapped, Unit C is located between 6 and 30 m above modern wetlands, and includes thick sequences of diatomite and organic mats. The origin, depositional environment, and paleoclimatic significance of Unit C is controversial and currently under debate. Grosjean [Science 292 (2001) 2391a] suggests the unit developed under a regime of falling lake and ground-water levels, whereas evidence presented here suggests that Unit C formed during a period of rising ground-water levels and increased vegetation cover. The debate is embedded in broader discussions about geomorphic processes in ground-water-fed streams, as well as the history and forcing of climate variability in the central Andes. The central Atacama and Andes are remote, with few opportunities for different researchers to examine the same site. One exception is a sequence of mid-Holocene deposits at the confluence of Quebrada Seca and R{\'\i}o Puripica in northern Chile (23\textdegree S). Grosjean et al. [Quat. Res. 48 (1997) 239\textendash 246] initially suggested the deposits accumulated in temporary lake basins, which formed when recurring debris flows from a side canyon (Quebrada Seca) dammed the main channel (R{\'\i}o Puripica) during a period of drought and reduced stream flow. Upon our visit to the site, we found evidence that clearly demonstrates the deposits were not formed in temporary lakes, but rather were deposited in a wetland environment. Disagreement remains about the climatic interpretation of wetland deposits. Grosjean [Science 292 (2001) 2391a] now suggests that local ground-water levels rise and wetland deposits aggrade in deep canyon systems, such as R{\'\i}o Puripica, when stream power and channel erosion is reduced during prolonged dry spells. However, sedimentological evidence and the presence of Unit C in many depositional environments, not just deep canyons, indicate that it formed during a period of higher regional ground-water levels that were sustained by enhanced precipitation and recharge in the High Andes.},

  abstract = {Globally, changes in stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen ( {$\delta$} O 18 and {$\delta$} D ) in the meteoric water cycle result from distillation and evaporation processes. Isotope fractionation occurs when air masses rise in elevation, cool, and reduce their water-vapor holding capacity with decreasing temperature. As such, {$\delta$} O 18 and {$\delta$} D values from a variety of sedimentary archives are often used to reconstruct changes in continental paleohydrology as well as paleoaltimetry of mountain ranges. Based on 234 stream-water samples, we demonstrate that areas experiencing deep convective storms in the eastern south\textendash central Andes (22\textendash 28\textdegree{} S) do not show the commonly observed relationship between {$\delta$} O 18 and {$\delta$} D with elevation. These convective storms arise from intermontane basins, where diurnal heating forces warm air masses upward, resulting in cloudbursts and raindrop evaporation. Especially at the boundary between the tropical and extra-tropical atmospheric circulation regimes where deep-convective storms are very common ( {$\sim$} 26 \textdegree{} to 32\textdegree{} N and S), the impact of such storms may yield non-systematic stable isotope-elevation relationships as convection dominates over adiabatic lifting of air masses. Because convective storms can reduce or mask the depletion of heavy isotopes in precipitation as a function of elevation, linking modern or past topography to patterns of stable isotope proxy records can be compromised in mountainous regions, and atmospheric circulation models attempting to predict stable isotope patterns must have sufficiently high spatial resolution to capture the fractionation dynamics of convective cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract Solar radiation reaching Earth's surface is one of the major drivers of climate dynamics. By setting the surface energy balance, downwelling solar radiation indirectly heats the atmosphere and controls the hydrological cycle. Besides its critical importance as a physical mechanism for driving climate and weather, solar radiation has attracted interest as a potentially major source of energy for human activities. For a given latitude, solar radiation at Earth's surface depends mostly on the composition along the atmospheric path. Since the early twentieth century, major astronomical observatories have led the search for the best places for observation from Earth, which presents a similar problem to the one of finding the maximum of solar radiation at the surface. In particular, Mount Montezuma in the Atacama Desert, Chile, was identified by the pioneers of solar observation as an ideal place to conduct the search for variations of the solar constant estimated from Earth's surface. By using available global datasets, a semiempirical model for the surface solar radiation over northern Chile, and a network of surface stations, we confirm Atacama as the place where the highest mean surface solar radiation is found. The most likely location of the maximum downwelling solar radiation over the surface of the planet is on the pre-Andean Domeyko Cordillera (3,500\textendash 5,000 m above mean sea level, between 24\textdegree{} and 25\textdegree S, along 69\textdegree W) with a value of about 310 {$\pm$} 15 W m\textendash 2.

  abstract = {The compound-specific hydrogen isotope composition ({$\delta$}D) of sedimentary n-alkanes is increasingly used as a palaeoclimate proxy. To explore the origin of the hydrogen isotope signal of n-alkanes from higher terrestrial plant biomass in sedimentary organic matter of small lakes we have analysed the n-alkane composition and {$\delta$}D values of 31 plant biomass samples (Birch (Betula), Beech (Fagus), Oak (Quercus), Alder (Alnus), Hornbeam (Carpinus) and Myrtle (Myrtus) as well as non-stomata containing Sphagnum, Cladonia and moss) from 14 sites along a climatic gradient from Northern Finland to Southern Italy. Eleven of the sites were previously investigated for the n-alkane {$\delta$}D values in adjacent lake sediments and are compared to the leaf wax n-alkane {$\delta$}D values. The distribution of terrestrial n-alkanes in lake sediments was not found to be characteristic of the dominant vegetation around the lake. Evidently, n-alkane distributions within the same species at different sites were found to be variable. These findings complicate the use of certain n-alkane distributions in sediments as a palaeoenvironmental indicator. {$\delta$}D values of plant biomass n-alkanes show a significant positive correlation with the precipitation {$\delta$}D values. Biomass n-alkane {$\delta$}D values are in general less negative than the associated sedimentary n-alkanes of terrestrial origin, possibly due to the stronger evapotranspiration during the summer, when sampling took place. This suggests, that n-alkanes in leaves show seasonal variations and the sedimentary organic matter receives the lighter isotope signal of the autumn, when most leaves are incorporated into the sediment. The variability of the {$\delta$}D values from non-stomata containing plants is much higher than for broadleaf trees, since stomata can regulate water loss through evapotranspiration. The average chain length (ACL) of n-alkanes from deciduous tree leaves increases from North to South. With increasing ACL the hydrogen isotopic fractionation ({$\epsilon$}) between source water and n-alkanes also increases. Our results prove that terrestrial n-alkane {$\delta$}D values record the {$\delta$}D value of precipitation, modified by the amount of isotope enrichment in the leaf water due to plant anatomy (stomata vs. no stomata) and site specific meteorological conditions, such as evapotranspiration, relative humidity and soil moisture. Therefore, terrestrial n-alkanes in lake sediments can deliver information on changes in these parameters over geological timescales. In lake sediments where aquatic n-alkanes, such as n-C17 record the lake water {$\delta$}D value, the isotopic difference between terrestrial and aquatic n-alkanes could therefore be used to reconstruct changes in evapotranspiration.},

  abstract = {Lake Chungar\'a (18\textdegree 15{${'}$}S, 69\textdegree 09{${'}$}W, 4520 m above sea-level) is the largest (22{$\cdot$}5 km2) and deepest (40 m) lacustrine ecosystem in the Chilean Altiplano and its location in an active volcanic setting, provides an opportunity to evaluate environmental (volcanic vs. climatic) controls on lacustrine sedimentation. The Late Quaternary depositional history of the lake is reconstructed by means of a multiproxy study of 15 Kullenberg cores and seismic data. The chronological framework is supported by 10 14C AMS dates and one 230Th/234U dates. Lake Chungar\'a was formed prior to 12{$\cdot$}8 cal kyr bp as a result of the partial collapse of the Parinacota volcano that impounded the Lauca river. The sedimentary architecture of the lacustrine succession has been controlled by (i) the strong inherited palaeo-relief and (ii) changes in the accommodation space, caused by lake-level fluctuations and tectonic subsidence. The first factor determined the location of the depocentre in the NW of the central plain. The second factor caused the area of deposition to extend towards the eastern and southern basin margins with accumulation of high-stand sediments on the elevated marginal platforms. Synsedimentary normal faulting also increased accommodation and increased the rate of sedimentation in the northern part of the basin. Six sedimentary units were identified and correlated in the basin mainly using tephra keybeds. Unit 1 (Late Pleistocene\textendash Early Holocene) is made up of laminated diatomite with some carbonate-rich (calcite and aragonite) laminae. Unit 2 (Mid-Holocene\textendash Recent) is composed of massive to bedded diatomite with abundant tephra (lapilli and ash) layers. Some carbonate-rich layers (calcite and aragonite) occur. Unit 3 consists of macrophyte-rich diatomite deposited in nearshore environments. Unit 4 is composed of littoral sediments dominated by alternating charophyte-rich and other aquatic macrophyte-rich facies. Littoral carbonate productivity peaked when suitable shallow platforms were available for charophyte colonization. Clastic deposits in the lake are restricted to lake margins (Units 5 and 6). Diatom productivity peaked during a lowstand period (Unit 1 and subunit 2a), and was probably favoured by photic conditions affecting larger areas of the lake bottom. Offshore carbonate precipitation reached its maximum during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 7{$\cdot$}8 and 6{$\cdot$}4 cal kyr bp). This may have been favoured by increases in lake solute concentrations resulting from evaporation and calcium input because of the compositional changes in pyroclastic supply. Diatom and pollen data from offshore cores suggest a number of lake-level fluctuations: a Late Pleistocene deepening episode (ca 12{$\cdot$}6 cal kyr BP), four shallowing episodes during the Early to Mid-Holocene (ca 10{$\cdot$}5, 9{$\cdot$}8, 7{$\cdot$}8 and 6{$\cdot$}7 cal kyr BP) and higher lake levels since the Mid-Holocene (ca 5{$\cdot$}7 cal kyr BP) until the present. Explosive activity at Parinacota volcano was very limited between c. {$>$}12{$\cdot$}8 and 7{$\cdot$}8 cal kyr bp. Mafic-rich explosive eruptions from the Ajata satellite cones increased after ca 5{$\cdot$}7 cal kyr bp until the present.},

Leaf-wax-derived long-chain \emph{n}-alkanes and \emph{n}-alkanoic acids may have great potential for reconstructing past changes in vegetation, but the factors that affect the leaf wax distribution in fresh plant material, as well as in soils and sediments, are not yet fully understood and need further research. We systematically investigated the influence of vegetation and soil depth on leaf waxes in litter and topsoils along a European transect. The deciduous forest sites are often dominated by the \emph{n}-C\textsubscript{27} alkane and \emph{n}-C\textsubscript{28} alkanoic acid. Conifers produce few \emph{n}-alkanes but show high abundances of the C\textsubscript{24} \emph{n}-alkanoic acid. Grasslands are characterized by relatively high amounts of C\textsubscript{31} and C\textsubscript{33} \emph{n}-alkanes and C\textsubscript{32} and C\textsubscript{34} \emph{n}-alkanoic acids. Chain length ratios thus may allow for distinguishing between different vegetation types, but caution must be exercised given the large species-specific variability in chain length patterns. An updated endmember model with the new \emph{n}-alkane ratio (\emph{n}-C\textsubscript{31} + \emph{n}-C\textsubscript{33}) / (\emph{n}-C\textsubscript{27} + \emph{n}-C\textsubscript{31} + \emph{n}-C\textsubscript{33}) is provided to illustrate, and tentatively account for, degradation effects on \emph{n}-alkanes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Atmospheric dust samples collected along a transect off the West African coast have been investigated for their lipid content and compound-specific stable carbon isotope compositions. The saturated hydrocarbon fractions of the organic solvent extracts consist mainly of long-chain n-alkanes derived from epicuticular wax coatings of terrestrial plants. Backward trajectories for each sampling day and location were calculated using a global atmospheric circulation model. The main atmospheric transport took place in the low-level trade-wind layer, except in the southern region, where long-range transport in the mid-troposphere occurred. Changes in the chain length distributions of the n-alkane homologous series are probably related to aridity, rather than temperature or vegetation type. The carbon preference of the leaf-wax n-alkanes shows significant variation, attributed to a variable contribution of fossil fuel- or marine-derived lipids. The effect of this nonwax contribution on the {$\delta$}13C values of the two dominant n-alkanes in the aerosols, n-C29 and n-C31 alkane, is, however, insignificant. Their {$\delta$}13C values were translated into a percentage of C4 vs. C3 plant type contribution, using a two-component mixing equation with isotopic end-member values from the literature. The data indicate that only regions with a predominant C4 type vegetation, i.e. the Sahara, the Sahel, and Gabon, supply C4 plant-derived lipids to dust organic matter. The stable carbon isotopic compositions of leaf-wax lipids in aerosols mainly reflect the modern vegetation type along their transport pathway. Wind abrasion of wax particles from leaf surfaces, enhanced by a sandblasting effect, is most probably the dominant process of terrigenous lipid contribution to aerosols.},

  abstract = {Fog water represents an alternative, abundant and currently unexploited fresh water resource in the coastal Atacama Desert (\textasciitilde 20\textdegree S). Here, the stratocumulus clouds meet the Coastal Cordillera, producing highly dynamic advective marine fog, a major feature of the local climate that provides water to a hyper-arid environment. One of the main issues that arises in harvesting fog water is our limited understanding of the spatial and inter-annual variability of fog clouds and their associated water content. Here we assess the role of regional-wide El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing on local inter-annual fog-water yields along the coast of Atacama. We contrast 17 years of continuous fog-water data, with local and regional atmospheric and oceanographic variables to determine the link between them and the inter-annual dynamics of fog in northern Chile. Sea surface temperature (SST) in ENSO zone 1 + 2 shows significant correlations with offshore and coastal Atacama SST, as well as with local low cloud cover and fog water yields, which go beyond the annual cycle beat, exposing a potential causal link and influence of ENSO on fog along the Atacama. On the inter-annual time scale, we found that when ENSO 3 + 4 zone SST, specifically during summer, overcome a {$>$} 1\textdegree C temperature threshold, they incite significantly higher summer fog water yields and explain 79\% of the fog variability. Furthermore, satellite images displaying regional extent Sc cloud and fog presence during ENSO extremes reveal higher cloud abundance during El Ni\~no at this latitude. However, 75\% of the yearly fog water is collected during winter, and does not appear to be affected in a significant manner by Pacific oscillations. Thus, our results suggest that the utilization of fog as a fresh water resource may be sustainable in the future, regardless of ENSO-induced variability in the region.},

  abstract = {Carbohydrates are direct products of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. Within a changing temperature regime, both photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism need tight regulation to prevent irreversible damage of plant tissue and to sustain energy metabolism, growth and development. Due to climate change, plants are and will be exposed to both long-term and short-term temperature changes with increasing amplitude. Particularly sudden fluctuations, which might comprise a large temperature amplitude from low to high temperature, pose a challenge for plants from the cellular to the ecosystem level. A detailed understanding of fundamental regulatory processes, which link photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism under such fluctuating environmental conditions, is essential for an estimate of climate change consequences. Further, understanding these processes is important for biotechnological application, breeding and engineering. Environmental light and temperature regimes are sensed by a molecular network that comprises photoreceptors and molecular components of the circadian clock. Photosynthetic efficiency and plant productivity then critically depend on enzymatic regulation and regulatory circuits connecting plant cells with their environment and re-stabilising photosynthetic efficiency and carbohydrate metabolism after temperature-induced deflection. This review summarises and integrates current knowledge about re-stabilisation of photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism after perturbation by changing temperature (heat and cold).},

In both cases, n-alkanes from C4 grasses are enriched in D by more than 20\textperthousand{} relative to those from C3 grasses. The apparent enrichment factor ({$\epsilon$}C29-GW) between C29 n-alkane and greenhouse water is -165{$\pm$}12\textperthousand{} for C3 grasses and -140{$\pm$}15\textperthousand{} for C4 grasses. For samples from the Great Plains, {$\delta$}D values of C29 n-alkanes range from -280 to -136\textperthousand, with values for C4 grasses ca. 21\textperthousand{} more positive than those for C3 grasses from the same site. Differences in C3 and C4 grass n-alkane {$\delta$}D values are consistent with the shorter interveinal distance in C4 grass leaves, and greater back-diffusion of enriched water from stomata to veins, than in C3 grass leaves. Great Plains' grass n-alkane isotopic ratios largely reflect precipitation {$\delta$}D values. However, the offset or apparent fractionation between n-alkanes and precipitation is not uniform and varies with annual precipitation and relative humidity, suggesting climatic controls on lipid {$\delta$}D values. The dryer sites exhibit smaller absolute apparent fractionation indicative of D-enrichment of source waters through transpiration and/or soil evaporation. To explore the relationship between climate and n-alkane {$\delta$}D values, we develop three models. (1) The `direct analog' model estimates {$\delta$}DC29 values simply by applying the apparent enrichment factors, {$\epsilon$}C29-GW, observed in greenhouse grasses to precipitation {$\delta$}D values from the Great Plains. (2) The `leaf-water' model uses a Craig\textendash Gordon model to estimate transpirational D-enrichment for both greenhouse and field sites. The transpiration-corrected enrichment factors between C29 and bulk leaf-water, {$\epsilon$}C29-GW, calculated from the greenhouse samples (-181\textperthousand{} for C3 and -157\textperthousand{} for C4) are applied to estimate {$\delta$}DC29 values relative to modeled bulk leaf-water {$\delta$}D values. (3) The `soil- and leaf-water' model estimates the combined effects of soil evaporation, modeled by analogy with a flow-through lake, and transpiration on {$\delta$}DC29 values. Predictions improve with the addition of the explicit consideration of transpiration and soil evaporation, indicating that they are both important processes in determining plant lipid {$\delta$}D values. D-enrichment caused by these evaporative processes is controlled by relative humidity, suggesting that important climatic information is recorded in leaf wax n-alkane {$\delta$}D values. Calibration studies such as this one provide a baseline for future studies of plant-water\textendash deuterium systematics and form the foundation for interpretation of plant wax hydrogen isotope ratios as a paleo-aridity proxy.},

Here we review the response of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to past warm periods, synthesize current observations of change and evaluate future projections. Some marine-based catchments that underwent notable mass loss during past warm periods are losing mass at present but most projections indicate increased accumulation across the East Antarctic Ice Sheet over the twenty-first century, keeping the ice sheet broadly in balance. Beyond 2100, high-emissions scenarios generate increased ice discharge and potentially several metres of sea-level rise within just a few centuries, but substantial mass loss could be averted if the Paris Agreement to limit warming below 2\,degrees Celsius is satisfied.},

Theory predicts that climatic variability would select for increased phenotypic plasticity, whereas evidence indicates that stressful conditions can limit phenotypic plasticity. Using a meta-analytic, phylogeny-corrected approach to global data on plant phenotypic plasticity, we tested whether latitude, climate, climatic variability and/or stressful conditions are predictors of plastic responses at a biogeographical scale. We found support for a positive association between phenotypic plasticity and climatic variability only for plasticity in allocation. Plasticity in leaf morphology, size and physiology were positively associated with mean annual temperature. We also found evidence that phenotypic plasticity in physiology is limited by cold stress. Overall, plant plastic responses to non-climatic factors were stronger than responses to climatic factors. However, while climatic conditions were associated with plant plastic responses to climatic factors, they generally did not relate to plastic responses to other abiotic or biotic factors. Our study highlights the need to consider those factors that favour and limit phenotypic plasticity in order to improve predictive frameworks addressing plant species' potential to adapt to climate change.},

However, interpretation of ancient \emph{n}-alkane patterns relies primarily on modern plant wax \emph{n}-alkane patterns measured from leaves. Little is still known about how \emph{n}-alkane patterns, and environmental information therein, might be altered during the process of transfer from leaves into soil. We studied the \emph{n}-alkane patterns extracted from leaves, necromass, and soil samples from an altitudinal gradient in the tropical Andes to clarify if the \emph{n}-alkane pattern, and the local environmental information reflected, is altered as the plant source material degrades. We considered the (dis)similarity between \emph{n}-alkane patterns in soil, necromass, and leaves and specifically explored whether a temperature and/or precipitation signal is reflected in their \emph{n}-alkane patterns. The \emph{n}-alkane patterns showed degradation in soil as reflected by a reduced carbon preference index (CPI). The lower CPI in soils as compared to leaves and necromass was significantly correlated with temperature and precipitation along the transect, most likely because of increased microbial activity under warmer and wetter conditions. Despite degradation, all sample types showed a systematic shift in longer vs. shorter \emph{n}-alkanes when moving up the transect. Further examination revealed the systematic shift correlated with transect temperature and precipitation. Since transect vegetation is constant along the transect, this would appear to indicate the recording of a climatic signal within the \emph{n}-alkane patterns that is preserved in the soil, albeit that the correlation was weaker there. The study results warrant further research into a possible underlying causal relationship that may lead to the development of \emph{n}-alkane patterns as a novel palaeoecological proxy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Local climate and environment broadly affect the deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios of plant materials, however the degree to which an individual plant's leaf waxes D/H ratios are affected by these parameters remains in question. Understanding these issues is particularly important in order to reconstruct past floral transitions and changes in the paleohydrologic cycle. For this study, we sampled five co-occurring tree species, Acer rubrum, Platanus occidentalis, Juniperus virginiana, Pinus taeda, and Pinus strobus and soils at forty sites along the East Coast of the US, from Florida to Maine. Hydrogen isotopic compositions of leaf wax n-alkanes, stem and surface waters were analyzed and compared against high-resolution temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit data to determine environmental controls on isotopic composition. Our results demonstrate that each tree species produce a unique distribution of n-alkanes with distinct chain length pattern. Average n-alkane chain lengths recovered from soils, A. rubrum, and J. virginiana leaves show significant correlations with mean annual temperature. {$\delta$}D values of A. rubrum leaf n-alkanes were strongly correlated to modeled mean annual precipitation {$\delta$}D values and other climate parameters related to latitude (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit), while the {$\delta$}D values of J. virginiana n-alkanes were not. Differences in correspondence may reflect the timing of leaf wax synthesis between the two species. Further, soil n-alkane D/H compositions were strongly correlated to modeled mean annual precipitation {$\delta$}D values, while the apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation was not. These findings indicate that the isotope ratio of n-alkanes from soils in Eastern North American forests and similar ecosystems likely represents a time-averaged value that smooth out the environmental influence any one plant experiences.},

The mid Holocene was the most arid interval since the last glacial maximum, as documented by subaerial exposure and formation of hardgrounds on a playa surface. Extremely low lake levels during the mid Holocene appear consistent with lower effective moisture recorded at other sites along the Altiplano and in the Amazon Basin. Termination of this arid period represented a major shift in the regional environmental dynamics and inaugurated modern atmospheric conditions. The cores show a progressive upward increase in effective moisture interrupted by numerous century-scale drier periods of various intensities and durations that characterize a fluctuating late Holocene climate. In spite of chronological uncertainties, the major environmental changes seem to correlate with the available paleorecords from the region providing a coherent account of effective moisture variability in the tropical highlands of South America.},

Relevant to the emerging use of plant wax derived biomarkers as proxies for past vegetation composition this study provides key data for C3 plants of tropical and subtropical Africa. We present analytical results for 45 savanna species and 24 rain forest plants sampled in their natural habitats. Contents and distribution patterns of long chain n-alkanes (n-C25 to n-C35) and n-alkan-1-ols (n-C24 to n-C34) as well as bulk and molecular carbon isotopic data are presented. The variations of the analysed parameters among different growth forms (herb, shrub, liana and tree) are small within the vegetation zones, whereas characteristic differences occur between the signatures of rain forest and savanna plants. Therefore, we provide averaged histogram representations for rain forest and savanna C3 plants. The findings were compared to previously published data of typical C4 grass waxes of tropical and subtropical Africa. Generally, trends to longer n-alkane chains and less negative carbon isotopic values are evident from rain forest over C3 savanna to C4 vegetation. For n-alkanols of rain forest plants the maximum of the averaged distribution pattern is between those of C3 savanna plants and C4 grasses. The averaged presentations for tropical and subtropical vegetation and their characteristics may constitute useful biomarker proxies for studies analysing the expansion and contraction of African vegetation zones.},

Calibration-in-time (period AD 1901\textemdash 2000, cross-validated with split periods) revealed robust correlations between local DJF temperatures and total sedimentary chlorin (relative absorption band depth (RABD) centred in 660\textemdash 670 nm RABD660;670:  r=0.79, P{$<$}0.01; five-years triangular filtered) and the degree of pigment diagenesis (R660nm/670 nm: r=0.82,  P{$<$}0.01; five-years triangular filter). Root Mean Squared Error values are small (between 0.24 and 0.34\textdegree C) suggesting that most of the reconstructed decadal-scale climate variability is significant. Our data provide quantitative evidence for the presence of a Medieval Climate Anomaly (in this case, warm summers between AD 1150 and 1350; {$\Delta$}T = +0.27 to +0.37\textdegree C with respect to (wrt) twentieth century) and a very cool period synchronous to the `Little Ice Age' starting with a sharp drop between AD 1350 and AD 1400 (-0.3\textdegree C/10 yr, decadal trend) followed by constantly cool ({$\Delta$}T = -0.70 to -0.90\textdegree C wrt twentieth century) summers until AD 1750. The structure of variability is consistent in great detail with annually resolved tree-ring based warm-season temperature and river discharge reconstructions from northern Patagonia (42\textdegree S) for the past 400 years, with qualitative climate reconstructions from Andean glacier fluctuations, and with hydrological changes in Patagonian lake sediment records.},

However, to date, understanding of changes in the abundance and distribution of leaf wax n-alkanes with temperature remains unclear. The main reason is that the interference of precipitation on leaf wax n-alkanes has not been effectively removed in most investigations of natural ecosystems. We sampled 357 plants across a temperature gradient along an isohyet in China to minimize the influence of precipitation and evaluate the effect of temperature on the abundance and distribution of leaf wax n-alkanes. Most plant functional groups showed similar distributions in total n-alkane concentration ({$\sum$}alk), carbon preference index (CPI) and average chain length (ACL). CPI values were not sensitive to temperature change. {$\sum$}alk values were negatively correlated with summer mean temperature (TJJA, June to August) for most plant functional groups. ACL values were always positively related to temperature, especially TJJA. However, large variability in {$\sum$}alk and ACL occurred within plants from the same site. Therefore, this study suggests that {$\sum$}alk and ACL can indicate relative environmental temperature, but they should not be used as quantitative proxies of paleo-temperature.},

  abstract = {As with most living organisms, human populations respond to climatic, environmental, and population pressures by transforming their range and subsistence strategies over space and time. An understanding of human ecology can be gained when the archaeological record is placed within the context of dynamic landscape changes and alterations in natural resource availability. We reconstructed the landscape evolution of the Quebrada Man\'i fan complex, situated along the west-facing slope of the Central Andes in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, an area that contains an archaeological record that spans almost 13,000 years. Surficial geologic mapping and dating of three 2\textendash 12~km2 study sites, in conjunction with archaeological records and analysis of remotely sensed data for the {$\sim$}400~km2 fan complex, was conducted to reconstruct the landscape evolution and the way of life of Paleoindian (ca. 12.8\textendash 11.5 ka) and early/late Formative (ca 2.5 to 0.7 ka) social groups. Just prior to any known human occupation, a large pluvial event in the high Andes, regionally referred to as CAPE I, impacted the Quebrada Man\'i fan complex from ca.18\textendash 16.5 ka. During CAPE I, the Man\'i fan complex was dominated by perennial stream systems that deposited well-sorted conglomerates in the upper reaches of the fan (Unit T2) and perennial wetlands (Unit B1). This pluvial period was followed by the onset of an extreme drought sometime after 15 ka, but before 13 ka, when wetlands desiccated and the distal reaches of the fan deflated. Sand sheets and sand dunes were deposited across broad reaches of the landscape and Quebrada Man\'i incised 3\textendash 5~m into its floodplain. This drought had profound implications for the distribution of natural resources during the subsequent pluvial event (CAPE II) that ensued from ca. 12.5\textendash 9.5 ka. Incision along the upper reaches of the fan caused a more restricted floodplain and allowed the deposition of extensive wetlands along the more distal central reaches of the fan where groundwater emerged. Paleoindian residential open-air camps were placed in these areas. Wetlands were replaced by a tree-covered floodplain during the latter portion of this pluvial event (ca. 10.5\textendash 9 ka). We found no archaeological evidence for human occupations between {$\sim$}8\textendash 2.5 ka, suggesting a lack of natural resources and/or very low hunter-gatherer population densities. During this time, Quebrada Man\'i incised up to 8~m into the floodplain. Mudflow deposition \textendash{} typical of the present-day fan complex \textendash{} initiated around 2.5 ka, likely responding to an increase in precipitation. This triggered a re-population of the fan surface by Formative agricultural groups that irrigated and extensively farmed these floodplains. By the end of the Formative, these socio-cultural groups became increasingly vulnerable to climatic changes as cut-and-fill cycles in the drainage necessitated major infrastructure adjustments, until the technologies and social-cultural convention of the epoch could not cope with environmental change and investments were abandoned by {$\sim$}0.8 ka.},

  abstract = {The waxy coating that protects the leaves and other soft tissues of plants includes n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid compounds that are commonly used as biomarkers to reconstruct past environment. Plant waxes have geological relevance given their persistence in soils and paleosols, as well as in lake and marine sediments, yet diagenesis may alter their molecular and isotopic signatures from synthesis to deposition. This study seeks to understand the fate of plant wax biomarkers in soils after leaf-fall as characterized by a series of tropical soil profiles. We investigate the changes in abundance, molecular distributions, and hydrogen ({$\delta$}D) and carbon isotopic compositions ({$\delta$}13C) of plant waxes (n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids) in six litter-to-soil profiles along a 2740\,m elevation transect from the eastern flank of the Andes mountains down to the lowland Amazon floodplain in Peru. From litter to soil, we find acid/alkane ratios increase while absolute abundances decrease. In contrast, within each soil, acid/alkane ratios are roughly constant, and we find an equivalent exponential decline in concentration in both compound classes with depth, with molecular distributions indicating some new production. We observe a 4\textendash 6\textperthousand{} 13C-enrichment from litter to deeper soils for both C29 n-alkanes and C30 n-alkanoic acids, of which the Suess effect accounts for {$\leq$}2\textperthousand. We infer that microbial degradation and production (or `turnover') processes influence the {$\delta$}13C of plant waxes that survive in soils; in contrast, no systematic change in {$\delta$}D values is observed. The plant wax signal in soils includes averaging of inputs and diagenetic effects, so this signature is particularly relevant for the interpretation of plant wax archives in paleosols and the plant waxes eroded from soils and exported to downstream sedimentary archives. We show that soils represent the major stock of plant wax under living ecosystems, suggesting that soils may be a quantitatively-important source of plant waxes available for fluvial erosion, with implications for studies of carbon cycling and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from downstream geological archives.},
